We look around and the only spray cans we can find are spray glue.  The sketchy looking guy looks over the can a minute and buys a couple. \n Later on I realize he was looking for canned air, as when you spray it, the can turns cold.  I also later learned that people were using the stuff to get high, a fact that forced us to start asking for ID when buying the stuff. \n So anyways, we accidentally sold him the glue, which if he tried to inhale probably would have done some heavy damage to his airways if not killed him instead of just slowly killing off his brain.", "Growing up I never read for pleasure.  Hell, I can't recall reading any books that were assigned in school.  But after seeing Jurassic Park in the theater, I ran out and bought the book and read through it.

The game looks wonderful, the voice acting is very well done and the story is okay. \n But the gameplay isn't all that compelling in my opinion.  Just like the Uncharted series, I find the shooting mechanics to be passable.  Perhaps it's because it's a survival horror game and the developers deiced to make the weapons somewhat hard to aim.  But for me the combat isn't all that fun. \n The melee combat, however, feels quite solid, even if it is all button mashing.  Stealth/sneaking is always well done in my opinion. \n The inventory system is also a bit of a mess, but maybe I'm just stuck in my ways on that one and can't accept things that are different.  :)", "Eat a raw habanero pepper. \n I'd watch those shows like Man Vs Food where people would eat super spicy foods and complain about how horrible it was.

Two of my friends ran off to a nearby grocery store and picked up a couple of habaneros, thinking I wouldn't go through with it. \n I took a bite, chewed it.  All seemed well.  So I popped the rest in my mouth.  Chew chew chew... HOLY FUCK! \n It wasn't so much a hot, firey feeling.  It was more like my mouth and entire jaw was being electrocuted.  And there's no way to really stop it.  Luckily a friend of mine stopped me from drinking water as it supposedly makes things worse.  So I drank all the milk that the restaurant had. \n So I tried my spicy pepper, know what it's like and learned my lesson.

It's one of those games you can play to just wander around and enjoy the scenery if you don't feel like completing the next mission. \n ACB: Took the great game of AC2 and cranked it up to 11.  The story was slightly weaker in my opinion, but the added moves and play mechanics were a welcome touch.

It's not extremely deep, but doesn't really need to be. \n The combat is also enjoyable.  It's not a highly complicated, tough as nails game like Ninja Gaiden Black or some of the Devil May Cry games.  But the flashy moves make up for the lack of combat depth imo. \n And the graphics, especially on the third game, are quite fantastic.", "For me, definitely.  I haven't turned on my PS3 in months. \n Mostly I've been playing Desinty, althtough my addiction is finally waning.  Granted, it's available on PS3 as well, but the current gen versions are far superior from what I've heard.  Same goes with TLoU and GTAV, both great upgraded versions. \n As for exclusives, so far the only one I'm really into is Bloodborne.  Is it worth the cost of the console?  Maybe not for many, but as a huge fan of the Souls series, I would have gladly bought a PS4 for just the one game. \n Then there's the other awesome feature I love: Remote Play.  Not only does it work great on the Vita, but I've had fairly good experience using RP on my Android tablet as well.", "I played Demon's Souls first and therefore have many fond memories of the game since it introduced me to the awesome gameplay of the series. \n There are two major upgrades to Dark Souls that might ruin Demon's if you play Dark first. \n The first upgrade is an obvious one.  Demon's is made up of a hub world, where you can select what areas you want to travel to.  Dark on the other hand is just one giant open world where everything is connected by various paths.  Demon's makes traveling faster, but having a more fleshed out world in Dark is fantastic. \n The other major change between games for me is the carry weight.  In Demon's you had two weight stats.  One was carry weight, the other is equip.  You could only carry so many items, after you became over encumbered you could only move very slowly.  And your equip weight determines how quickly you can roll/run. \n Dark thankfully got rid of carry weight, since it was just a nuisance to travel back to the storage place and dump all your excess stuff.", "There are folks like me who will hold onto their Fat until it dies.  I don't use the PS2 feature all that often, but it's still how I get my nostalgia kick with the old Tony Hawk games before they turned to shit. \n So yeah, you could probably sell it for a decent price. Although folks have been posting about theirs dying left and right lately, meaning buyers may be leery.", "I played the Uncharted 1 demo and passed on the game.  It just didn't seem all that interesting. \n Then I caved under all the hype and bought Uncharted 2.  I'll admit that I enjoyed the game for the most part.  It was like playing through a big budget action adventure movie. \n But as I got further and further into the game I couldn't help but notice it's flaws. \n For one, the shooting mechanics were very uninteresting, they felt too loose and the guns didn't have much impact. \n Another huge gripe was the platforming/climbing aspects.  You just had a pre-determined path that you could climb along, and for the most part all you had to do was hold the stick in a direction and he'd move along.  There wasn't any skill or real sense of control in these sections. \n After finishing the game, I had no desire for more.  I got UC3 for 'free' on PS+ but I don't think I've even started it. \n And I also got Uncharted on Vita through PS+ and felt it had the same flaws as UC2.  I finally completed it due to my lack of games to play, but I didn't really enjoy it very much."]}, {"subreddit": "patientgamers", "posts": ["Skip the first.  It's generally looked at as more of a tech demo than a full game.  It bored the hell out of me when it first came out, and I've tried to go back again and play it and just can't do it. \n Then I'd get any others in the series.  I'd play them in order if possible.  AC2 was great.  It fixed what was wrong with the first game and added a ton of content. \n ACB is the next game and made some minor yet great updates as well.  Personally I liked the single huge map of Brotherhood compared to the smaller, sectioned levels of AC2.  And the combat has always been a weakpoint imo, so the chaining move in ACB was a welcome addition. \n And finally, if you liked the other games, ACR is more of the same.  It wasn't the best imo, didn't really add much.  But it's still a fun game.", "I see this response a lot, basically \"It worked fine for me.\" usually followed by \"your computer must suck.\".  Thank you for not putting in that second part. \n But the reason so many people complain about the horrible port is because for many of us is because of some glitch that appeared both in SR2 and Red Faction:Geurualilaiial. \n From what I read on random forum posts (so it could have been total horseshit) is it had to do something with them both being Xbox 360 ports, and when it was brought over to the PC it wasn't optimized properly for multi-core processors and something something. \n So, for many people, again me included, the game ran too fast, making it virtually unplayable. \n Now, for RF:G, the game was new enough that the devs actually spent the time to patch the bug, so all was well not long after lunch (and launch). \n BUT, and that's a huge butt, the developers ignored the issue in SR2 on PC.  There were a couple of solutions, the first was an annoying Cheat Engine fix, where you'd start the game, alt-tab out and change the \"speed\" or \"multiplier\" setting or some nonsense in a program.  It fixed the game for the most part, but the cuntscenes still ran at the wrong speed so the voices were waaay off. \n The other is this:  and boy oh boy did it work like a treat.  The game ran at the proper speed, including cutscenes, and there was no need to alt-tab any more, it just worked.  It's a shame that a person or group of persons have to patch a game because the developers don't seem to care, but I'm so glad people much smarter than me devote their time to stuff like this. \n It's like the guy or guys (girls don't do this sort of stuff) that fixed the wireless 360 controller support for Assassin's Creed 2 on the PC.  Again, the developers didn't care to fix it, so someone else had to step up and release an unofficial fix.", "Yes, it is.  My long explanation... \n Metal Gear Solid  - The original was amazing, something unlike any other game I had seen up to that point.  I played the demo alone an obscene number of times, waiting for the full game to come out.  The graphics were great for the time, and the characters, story and gameplay was fantastic. \n It's shamefully not a part of the HD package, so I'd recommend scrounging up a copy of Twin Snakes for the Gamecube/Wii or running the original (edit) by buying it on the PSN.  Some complain that TS changed too much, but I personally loved it and could look past the updates. \n Metal Gear Solid 2  - Some hate it, some think it's an amazing but misunderstood sequel.  I personally didn't care for it.  The setting and story were boring in my opinion, and the bosses were all forgettable or in some cases just plain silly.  I won't spoil anything for you, as I still think you should play through it to get the relative pieces of story out of it. \n Metal Gear Solid 3  - The pinnacle of the series in my opinion.  The game was an obvious homage to the older James Bond movies and had the a great story, main characters and gameplay.  Most of the bosses were very weak story-wise, but a step up from the horribly generic bosses of MGS4.  MGS3 alone makes the HD collection worth it in my opinon, especially if you've never played it. \n Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker  - Played it on the PSP and enjoyed it.  It was a great game, the closest the portable versions came to a console-like experience.  I haven't had a chance to try it yet on the PS3.  I'll probably end up skipping it on the HD collection.  Because although it was a great portable game, I don't think it'll live up to the full console-quality titles. \n Metal Gear Solid 4  - I'm a bit on the fence about the game.  On one hand it's great, graphically and gameplay-wise.  But the story to me felt a bit off somehow.  First of all it felt very forced.  Instead of it being a natural next entry in the series, it felt like Kojima went through all the old games, found the loose ends and tried to tie them up.  And by tying them up he also made some huge story-altering changes that just mucked things up. \n And second of all, it felt like it was all over the place.  Again, in trying to tie up all the loose ends, it felt like there wasn't a cohesive story. \n And the bosses were, in my opinion, terrible.  One of the great things about the original boss characters is that they were fleshed out, they had stories behind them.  The bosses in 4 were all generic women without any real tie to the story. \n I still enjoyed MGS4, and I'll play through it again after I play the MGS2 HD version, but I really wish he had taken the story in a different direction.  Although hey, it's his series so he can do what he wants with it.  :) \n Also, I know it wasn't part of the HD collection, just chiming in on it.", "Demon's Souls is a PS3 exclusive.  From what I hear, it still has a fairly active online community, although I'd imagine it's not as strong as the two Dark Souls games.  I'd still suggest starting with it, as it's the most dated and may be hard to go back to if you've played the newer ones. \n Dark Souls is on 360, PS3 and PC.  The PC version was pretty shitty, but was fixed by a user patch called DSFix.  Controller highly recommended tho.  Dark Souls took the amazing gameplay of Demon's and fixed a few things. \n The major difference in Dark is a huge interconnected world, where as Demon's had a hub world.  Demon's still had an amazing atmosphere and well designed levels, but Dark's world feels much more solid imo. \n Dark Souls 2 is also on the same three systems, and this time the PC port was properly done and works fantastically without any modifications.  I'm currently addicted to it and just completed my second playthrough.  The world itself isn't as interesting as the first Dark Souls in my opinion, but it's still a blast to play. \n And in general, if you don't know anything about the games... \n The combat is amazing.  It's somewhat slow paced, and difficult at first, but very rewarding once you figure it out. \n The story is fairly barebones.  Instead of being riddled with long cutscenes or pages and pages of character dialog, the story is picked up by quick interactions with the occasional NPC and by reading item and spell descriptions.  It's very minimalist and I feel it fits great with this type of game. \n And the multiplayer element was one of the most interesting things about the game when I first started playing Demon's.  Initially, you'll see ghostly characters running around your screen.  Those are other players who happen to be in the same area as you, playing in real time.  You can't interact with the ghosts, you just see them. \n You get an item to place down quick messages on the ground like \"watch out for trap\" or \"invisible wall ahead\" or \"try ranged attack\".  So you can communicate with other players or get help from them. \n Then there's summoning.  They're all essentially single player games, but you can summon another character to help you fight through an area or take down a boss.  This is the thing I like most about the multiplayey aspect of the game, it makes it much easier, espeically with some of the harder bosses.  After they help you take down a boss (or are killed on the way) they return to their own game world and recieve some sort of bonus for helping out. \n And you can be summoned as well, if you choose to help others. \n Then there's the other side, invasion.  Characters and use an item to invade other character's game worlds and try to kill them. \n It's all such a clever way to turn a single player experience into a multiplayer one. \n Sorry if I rambled a bit, but as you can probably tell, I'm a huge fan of the series.", "The original BY FAR! \n Okay, so I got the first Crackdown for cheap, maybe 10 bucks through some deal MS had for retail folks at the time... I started playing it thinking it'd be crap, but man was it fun. \n It certainly wasn't a very deep game.  The story was pretty weak, the missions didn't have any meat to them.  The environments were mediocre.  The driving was passable and the combat was average.  But yet it was fun!  Jumping around the city, wreaking havoc, collecting orbs (Oh those precious orbs!) was a blast.  And the fact that it had two player co-op doubled the pleasure, doubled the fun. \n So when the sequel came out I pre-ordered it and convinced a friend to do the same.  I start playing it and all seems well at first until I pass the first couple of missions and then it hits me... they took an average yet fun game and stripped it down to something much less fun and resold it. \n Here's the basics of the first game.  You're some super cop dude who is sent off to take down crime bosses.  You start out only someone super but gain new abilities, the best imo is the ability to jump super freakin' high.  The bosses are being protected by their goons.  So you have to fight your way through the gun-toting fools to get to the big cheese.  Rinse the blood off and repeat. \n And the basics for the sequel:  Same super cop guy, but now there are zombies.  You travel to three points on the map, activate them all.  Then a third point opens up, a zombie den.  You go in and fight hordes of zombies until your buddies can deliver a bomb er something.  Rinse off the boredom and repeat. \n They took out any semblance of a story, the missions are terribly repetitive and the game is just bland bland bland. \n Sure, the first didn't have a great story or great variety in the missions, but you actually felt like you were progressing as you took out the list of bosses.  In Crackdown 2 it's like you're playing the same exact mission over and over.  There is not even a single boss. \n I should note that CD2 was developed by a different dev team.  The original developers went on to make APB, which failed horribly and ended up in the studio's closing.  That game is now free-to-play."]}, {"subreddit": "vita", "posts": ["I'll try to keep this short... \n When Ninja Gaiden came out on the Xbox I tried to get into it.  I loved the DOA games (which feature RYU) and the original NES classic games, so I wanted to love the new one.  But I just couldn't enjoy it.  It was too damn hard. \n But then I learned how to play thanks to one little tip:  You HAVE to block.  You can't play it like most other hack and slash games where you can just mash buttons and expect to win. \n After that I fell in love with the game.  The combat was buttery smooth and tough in a rewarding way.  I couldn't wait for Ninja Gaiden Black to come out (basically a \"directors cut\" game with a bunch of added content.  Still my favorite version of the game). \n I then bought a PS3 for the sole reason that Ninja Gaiden Sigma was being released on it.  That's right, I bought a ~$600 console for a game I already bought twice and played through a bazillion times.  Sigma streamlined things a bit by removing many of the game's puzzles, something I have mixed feelings about.  It also added the dual katanas and made the first level prettier. \n And the experience on the Vita is pretty much the same as the PS3, minus leaderboards, shamefully.  It's the first game I bought on the Vita and I love having it on a handheld. \n As for NGS2+, I'm glad they ported it and I love having it in a portable form, but it does have it's issues. \n The game looks grainy.  Like really grainy.  I can be playing along, pause the game to do something on my computer, and when I return to the Vita it's a bit jarring how jagged everything looks.  I get used to it after a bit, but it's pretty bad. \n And while some people lament about how bad and choppy the framerate is, I've played mostly through Normal and Hard (Mentor) and haven't noticed it much.  Perhaps it just doesn't bother me as much as some. \n But while the game has it's issues, I still love it on the Vita.", "Here's my take on the three GTA PSP games: \n Liberty City Stories:   This game literally sold the PSP for me.  I had little to no interest in the handheld, but when the game was announced I ran out and bought on in anticipation. \n It was amazing.  It brought the city I had grow to love from the PS2 game onto a system I could carry with me anywhere.  I was surprised at how well it looked and played compared to the original game.  And with the addition of motorcycles, it wasn't a step back from playing Vice City. \n The story I felt was fairly weak, but I still enjoyed playing through the missions. \n Vice City Stories:  Much of the same as LCS.  Same great gameplay and land mass from Vice City on the PS2.  The major addition to VCS was all of the buy-able businesses around the map.  And although I usually love the asset purchasing side missions, I felt like the way they were handled in VCS was pretty poor.  They felt very generic, repetitive and uninteresting. \n Again the story didn't feel as fleshed out as the original Vice City, but the game was still a blast to play trough. \n Chinatown Wars:   I played this heavily on the DS when it first came out.  I liked the change to a more classic top-down view.  The story and missions were extremely bland in my opinion. \n The one aspect I got hooked on (pun intended) was the drug buying and selling aspect.  I'm not sure why, as it didn't really have much depth to it, but buying low and selling high throughout the game was quite fun. \n When I bought it on PSP I liked the enhanced visuals of it, but the loading times compared to the DS game killed it for me.  For those who didn't play it on the DS first, this may not have been an issue but for me it was.", "I know everyone else has already recommended you play through the first game, but I have to stress it again... do it.  Even thought MGS3 is a prequel, MGS is still where everything stems from.  Every important character and event is more enjoyable if you've played the first Solid game. \n If you have a Gamecube, Wii or computer powerful enough to run the Dolphin emulator, I'd go for the Twin Snakes version.  It has enhanced graphics and updated controls (like first person shooting) so it won't be too much of a step backwards if you're already comfortable with the more recent games. \n That being said, the PS1 game still holds up fantastically in my opinion.  Sure, the graphics are pretty hairy by today's standards, but the graphical style is still enjoyable.  And the gameplay is top notch even today. \n And although no one cares, my rundown of the games: \n MGS1:  Fantastic game, amazed me when I first played it and I still play through it from time to time.  Fantastic gameplay, characters, story.  Graphics, although dated, are still quite nice. \n MGS2:  I don't like it.  I didn't like it when I first played it and I recently replayed it on the Vita HD edition and still didn't care for it.  It's not even the fact that you don't play as Snake.  The story was boring, the characters and bosses were bland and I didn't find the Big Shell to be interesting at all. \n MGS3:  Amazing game, possibly my favorite of the series although MGS1 is a very close second. \n MGS4:  Good, but not great imo.  The gameplay is great, the graphics are beautiful.  But the story fell flat imo.  It just felt like they were trying to tie up all loose ends instead of creating an interesting story.  And the bosses, although fun to fight, were very generic feeling.", "While I'll agree that you should play them on PS3 if possible, I'd say they're far from bad. \n They look about as good as they did on PS2, maybe a bit sharper.  I didn't go for a side-by-side comparison, but I don't think the textures are muddy as you described them. \n And I'm trying to think of what QTEs they took out.  I just played through both games on the Vita and although it's been years since I played the originals, nothing stuck out to me as \"hey, they changed that!\".  Not saying you're wrong here, just wondering which battles you're referring to. \n The framerate seemed fine throughout.  Perhaps I'm not all that sensitive to framrates, but I barely noticed a stutter.  By comparison, Borderlands 2 was a stuttering mess in my opinion, but the GoW games were smooth. \n The one point I'll fully agree with is the cutscenes.  They're grainy and don't even take up the full Vita screen (which was on purpose as that'd only make the pixels show more).  I understand that they don't want to go back and properly render them in fully HD resolutions, but they just really look bad compared to the rest of the game. \n And while I loved the PSP games, I'd still recommend this collection over either of the PSP games.  The graphics are a bit better and the stories are more fleshed out. \n The PSP games were great, but the felt more like the GTA Stories games, where the graphics are nearly-console quality, the gameplay is spot on, but the stories didn't quite feel up to par with their console counterparts.", "Nah, I'm holding off on the new systems. \n The Wii U still doesn't have a system seller for me.  Both of the Mario games look pretty good, but not something I'd buy a system for.  And since Wind Waker was one of my least favorite Zelda games, the HD remake doesn't really tickle me either. \n The Xbox 360 became a \"pretty much only Halo\" machine for me in the end.  Their focus on Kinect put me off.  So I don't see myself ever getting an Xbox One at this point. \n The PS4 is the only one I have interest in.  The PS3 had some pretty good exclusives and I expect the same on the PS4.  The fact that I can remote play anything on the Vita is a huge plus for me as well.  But as of now there's not a single game I have interest in playing that I can't already play on the PC."]}, {"subreddit": "Games", "posts": ["I bought a 3DS near launch and I'm a bit disappointed with it so far. \n It has a few great games, but there hasn't been anything out yet that has justified my purchase.  Nor do I see any games that have been announced that have my interest.  I guess it was more of an impulse buy and I have some buyers remorse. \n What's worse is the price dropped not long after release.  Sure, I got a bunch of free games (which I feel no way entitled so, so thank you Nintendo) but the NES games are a bore after playing them all these years and the GBA games are virtually unplayable due to the odd screen brightness issue (they're far too dark).  Not to mention the lack of the ability to remap the controls. \n Sorry, got sidetracked. \n So yeah, Super Mario 3D Land was a great game, I had even more enjoyment with it than either of the Galaxy games or the New Super Mario Brothers games.  But it was FAR too easy.  Even after finishing every possible level in the game it felt too easy. \n And Ocarina of Time 3D was great as well, it gave me a chance to replay the game with updated graphics. \n So with my buyer's remorse on the 3DS, I'm going to hold off a bit on the Vita, hoping for a price drop as well.  Especially since the only game I really want right now is Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, and I've already played through the game a thousand times on the Xbox and PS3. \n But if I didn't have 3DS and had $350 to burn, I'd get a Vita with a 32GB memory card, because I'm done with physical media.", "Yeah, Demon's Souls and Dark Souls had perfect online components in my opinion. \n For those of you who haven't played them basically it's this: \n The games are essentially a single player experience.  However, after wandering around a bit you'll occasionally see ghosts or phantoms wandering around, fighting, doing whatever.  These are actually other players playing through their own game.  The only interaction you can do early on is leave messages on the ground to help others find secrets or advice for what sort of tactics to use.  Or of course you can be a dick and lead them astray by telling them to jump off of a cliff. \n At some point you get some items that let you actually interact with other players.  One item you get lets you summon other people into your game to help you clear out an area.  After killing the boss in that area, the players you summoned return to their own game. \n Another item lets you invade another person's game and kill them if you so desire. \n That's just the general idea of both Souls games, the newer one, Dark Souls added more variations on the PVP system, but I won't go into it because quite frankly I haven't played enough of it to fully explain it. \n The series has become one of my favorites.  Everything about it is great:  the combat system, the level design, the creepy atmosphere/art style, the single player experience sprinkled with multiplayer. \n The one place the games really take some heat is in the story department.  And while I agree you won't get a meaty epic quest like Skyrim, I personally prefer the minimalist story telling design of Demon's Souls.  Dark Souls had even less of a story, and that was a tad TOO sparse for my liking, but the game is a blast for the gameplay alone. \n Yes, the games are hard, but they're well worth the effort to learn how to play and get better.  They've sort of ruined most other games due to their great combat systems. \n But I've rambled on long enough.", "I foolishly bought The Amazing Spider-man for the PS3, thinking it'd be the \"best\" Spider-game yet.  I was instantly put off by the dumbed-down swinging. \n Sure, the graphics may be nice, the combat may be a bit better since they (smartly) lifted the mechanics from the recent Batman games.  But the most fun I've had with past Spider-man games is just swinging around the city, weather it be between or during missions, or after I've completed the game. \n So to stick with a simplistic swinging mechanic really ruins the game for many of us fans.  At the very least they could have added a \"pro\" mode or whatever. \n What's even sadder, is that I purchased the Amazing Spider-man game for Android.  I figured it would be a somewhat cheap time waster.  But it turns out the swinging mechanics are actually better than the full-blown console games! \n Granted, the swinging on the Android version is pretty basic, there aren't any flashy moves.  But there's one extremely basic factor that makes it feel better in my opinion:  You have to let go of the swing button to cast another web line.  Where as on the console you just hold the button down and he shoots, releases, repeats...  Boring. \n That's my biggest gripe with the console swinging.  Sure, it's lame that you can \"cloud swing\" as people are calling it, swinging when there is no building to attach to.  But I could deal with that if it wasn't so automated.", "Why did we all hate the second one? \n Because they took the original game, took out ANY semblance of a story, added 'zombies' and made the game so repetitive it lost almost all sense of advancement. \n Okay, so the story in the first game was weak.  You had a bunch of crime bosses, you had to kill those crime bosses, working you way up to the big cheese.  Lame, right?  But it was something.  The devs who made the sequel must have not hired a story writer. \n And on to the important thing, the gameplay.  Again, in the first game you have to fight through mobs of enemies in order to get to their leader.  The leader wasn't anything too special, it was basically just a regular guy with more health and some extra firepower.  But again, it was a boss.  You make your way around the city taking out more and more bosses as you level up your jumping and combat abilities. \n The sequel?  You go to three points on the map an activate them.  This opens up cave that you jump down into and fight waves of boring zombie creatures until your allies can lower a bomb into the cave.  And that is the entire game, over and over again.  Not a single boss, not even an end game boss, just boring boring boring repetition. \n Sure, it had the same sort of leveling mechanics as the first one, but with no feeling of advancement in the game, those jumping and combat levels felt worthless. \n I'll admit I was drawn in by the hype of the game.  I watched some of the dev videos before the release touting how much improved the game was going to be over the first one.  So when I saw how bad of a job they did with it, I was very let down.", "I got mine fairly early on and was somewhat dissatisfied for a while.  It just didn't have many games that overly appealed to me. \n The remake of Ocarina of Time was very well done.  It was great playing through the game again with updated visuals.  Some day I'll go through the Master Quest to experience the game again. \n But other than that, many of the games I played were good but not great. \n Super Mario 3D Land was fun, but it was FAR too easy.  Starfox 64 3D didn't really do it for me, the gameplay hasn't aged well imo.  The Super Mario Sticker game was a huge disappointment.  And I didn't play too far into Luigi's Mansion before getting bored and moving on (although I do plan on going back to it some day). \n However, that being said, I recently upgraded my 3DS to an XL in anticipation of A Link Between Worlds, and I feel the cost was well worth it.  The game is simply amazing."]}, {"subreddit": "Android", "posts": ["Here's the thing... I had an LG Optimus V for a while, phone worked great with both the stock ROM (2.2) and CM7 (2.3).  I upgraded to the Motorola Triumph and handed the phone off to my wife. \n She used it for a while and at some point she said it would freeze, just like yours, when she needed to use it most.  When she'd get a call, or try to make a call, ti would lock up for a long time.  At times she'd turn it off and back on, but most of the time it was useless. \n So, as many people in this thread have suggested, I tried putting the custom ROM back on it.  I figured, if I'm going to wipe it, I might as well upgrade it as well.  But that was unsuccessful.  Still froze. \n Puzzled, I started doing some googling and forum searching.  Finally I found someone who had a similar issue with the Optimus and said that it was a Micro SD card problem. \n AHA!  I thought, I had indeed swapped her card out for a smaller one since I needed the 8gb or 16gb card she had but wasn't really using.  So, I gave her an old 4gb I had laying around. \n So, I popped a 16gb Micro SD card back in, FORMATTED it (I think that might have been an important step) and copied her data from the 4gb card back to it. \n It's been a week or so and she hasn't had a single bit of freezing.  So I'm assuming that either the card went bad, or it just needed a nice fresh formatting. \n I realize I rambled on, but I wanted to give the full story, and I'm bored.  Also, I realize it's a different phone, but it sounds like a similar issue so I'd give it a shot. \n edit: \n Forgot to mention, I think both cards were class 2 cards, so it wasn't a card speed issue from what I can tell.  Perhaps there was something corrupt on the card and every time you tried to do anything with the phone it would refresh the card, hit that bad part, and get stuck for a while?

And they were talking about a revolutionary new game that was coming out soon called Quake, with a shareware version that you could download now. \n So little ol' me logged onto dialup and downloaded the beast of a demo, only to install it and receive and error, something along the lines of \"no floating-point processor detected\". \n Well, I called Gateway 2K up immediately and asked what this message meant, and how to correct it.  They said the 486 chips didn't weren't capable of the FPP stuff, that I'd have to get a Pentium.  And as luck would have it, my computer could take a Pentium 66MHZ. \n Asked my dad to order one, and upgraded.  Not only could I play Quake in all of it's glory (albeit horribly choppy) but I could now play all of my older beloved games much smoother and in cases of games like DOOM, without shrinking the screen to a postage stamp!", "Yeah, a little miffed that I impulsed all over it. \n Ok, sure, it's only $1.  I'm fine with that, I've bought a bunch of apps for more than that that I either rarely use or don't have installed. \n But I'm upset that they are selling it as a full game when what you're getting is essentially the same thing (less if you count all the things you mentioned that are missing like music and multi) that you had with the free shareware version of Duke when it came out ages ago. \n Yes, they do mention all the way at the bottom of the description that it's only for episode 1, and yes, it's my fault for not reading the description fully before buying it, and yes, it's my fault for not trying it within the 15 minute refund window.  But honestly, it's a bit misleading. \n I know we've entered the age of DLC and in-app purchases, but how could they justify selling what amounts to a demo? \n Again, I know it's only $1, and I probably wouldn't have refunded even if I did see it was just episode 1.  But this is pretty shady in my opinion. \n They should call the app Duke Nuke 3D: Episode 1 or at the very least move the episode information up to the top. \n And, after all this ranting and raving (I'm not really all that upset, just hate when developers are somewhat misleading in this fashion) even if it was the full game I'd probably rarely play it.  I just felt a nice warmth for having the beloved game on my phone for only $1.  But now I feel a cold chill knowing I was slightly deceived. \n And before people respond with \"how are you being deceived, blah blah blah...\"  Again, yes, I know I wasn't really deceived, it was my fault for buying without reading first.  But come on, they really could make it clearer that you're only getting the demo.", "I used iOS for a while on my iPod Touch and iPhone, but switched completely to Android and won't go back. \n But the way I look at it, is if you have an iPhone, get an iPad.  If you have an Android phone, get an Android tablet. \n It's not that the two interfaces are too dissimilar, but if you're used to one OS over the other, switching between them might be frustrating. \n Also, you have a common app pool.  Sure, not every app that's designed for a phone works great on a tablet and vice versa, but it's nice to not have to buy essentially the same app or game twice.", "Ah, I should have edited my post... \n Turns out it wasn't an issue with my Optimus or with VM.  Turns out it was MY fault! \n I have an app called Extended Controls installed.  It lets you create custom widgets with whatever toggles and whatnot you want like volume, 2g/3g data, wifi on/off, etc.  Well I must have been messing around with it one day and inadvertently toggled 3G data off. \n So all the attempts I took to turn it back on in the phones settings did nothing as this app was turning it right back off.  It just so happened I did it at the same time that others were complaining of issues with VMs data service. \n My brother also has the Optimus V and has had no issues with it. \n Yes you can run the phone in debug mode.

He paid for dinner (which was nice, but I usually prefer to go dutch on the first date,) and asked me to follow him to Starbucks, because we had planned to catch a movie after the date.

So, I let it out in the only place I knew how to let it out: at school. \n English has always been my favorite subject, and English teachers have always loved me. This teacher wasn't an exception, and she liked me so much she managed to squeeze me into her Journalism class. When I first started at this school, it was my third school in 3 years, so I had honestly just stopped giving a shit. I didn't think I was going to graduate (because each school had a different curriculum and required different credits. I did graduate, and on time, with decent grades, after the 5th school.)

She ended up getting my nose broken, anyway, but that's another story.) \n That's when I got Mono. I got it over Christmas break and didn't come back until April. All of my grades went to shit because I couldn't get the school to send out a homebound teacher until February. That's over a month that I was getting 0's.

In my rage fueled tirade, I mentioned that I was turning 17 in a month, and that I couldn't wait until I didn't need parental consent to drop out of high school (I was ready to run away.)

I called and talked to my boss about him ditching work (no call/no show) the day before and how I had to pull a double. This was his third strike, despite my previous best efforts.

Fine, whatever... she does this occasionally. \n It didn't get really bad until today. \n Well, we went on a family shopping trip to Walmart with my Grandma. Grandma pushes Mom's buttons (bad blood,) so, Mom was sniping at me all afternoon. She and my niece get catty about my lack of fashion sense. \n Fine. Whatever. I say I feel attacked, they decide to tell me it's all in my head. I know it's not. \n So, my Mom's micromanaging causes an anxiety attack in Walmart. We leave. We come home, relax, and then head out to find my niece a bathing suit. Find one, hit another store... my brother calls, wanting to talk to my niece. I go to find them (I went to the book section.)  They literally start hiding from me in the store. \n I'm steamed. Whatever, shrug it off, come home.... \n And then my niece decides to tell me my husband is going to leave me over an inside joke we have. She's  fucking 12. \n I started choking at dinner (egg stuck in my throat) but instead of asking me if I'm alright, they sit there and laugh. Thanks, assholes. \n To top it off, she told my niece my religious preferences (which I have purposely kept private from my niece,) as well as she  almost  let slip my bisexuality (my niece is a bit homophobic towards lesbians.) I don't need my niece being uncomfortable around me! \n I am super frustrated that my Mom is acting like this, and it's only because my niece is here. And if I say I feel like I'm being attacked, they automatically tell me I'm not... and then my Mom will start acting like the victim and get passive aggressive! \n My niece reaffirms my decision not to have children, and my Mom is just acting juvenile.... \n I'm frustrated and upset.

My Mom is going to be a grandmother.

There is absolutely no reason to celebrate a teenage girl throwing her life away. Can I be there for her? Absolutely, but that brings me to another point: \n 2.) She doesn't have  anything  to do with either of us. My Mom sent her baby pictures (my Mom and I raised her, her mother wouldn't have a single picture from birth until she was taken at 2.) She couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge her existence... but it doesn't help that my brother's brain is fried from the drugs he did and he's essentially  lied  to my niece about who raised her. \n 3.)

He looked up to his brother, and was outshined by him and overshadowed by his demon spawn little brother. \n How does this relate to being childfree? It relates because this is one of the reasons I don't want to have children. This family is messed up. You can tell they love each other, but none of them are really stable in any way, shape, or form.

Fuck off.\" I then start hitting it harder (The theater is relatively comfortable, and I know that I wasn't distracting my two companions, and the people next to her were her companions, so I didn't really care if I was distracting them because they didn't care enough to tell her she was being rude.) She has apparently made up her mind to ignore me, and decides to take a drink out of her soda. That's when I gave the seat a good,  hard  kick (I was just tapping it before.)

Sometimes Money and Currency are the same thing, but not always. \n Money  is typically a store of value (think gold or silver)  and  has something called  \"use value\" , which means it can be  used  for something else besides purchasing (think corn or grain, which you can eat, or gold, which you can make electronics with). \n Currency  can be a unit of exchange and thus have  exchange value , which means it can be used to exchange for other goods and services. \n So  typically  (but not always): \n \n Money  has  use  value \n \n Currency  has  exchange  value \n \n \n Now, speaking of Bitcoin as a  Currency  (and remember sometimes Money and Currency are one and the same, like with gold coins in Rome): \n Bitcoin as Currency \n Currency can literally be  anything , from stuff like bottle caps, cigarettes, and hard candy, to things like paper bills, coins, or notes. \n All something needs, in order to be used as Currency, is the five required properties of Currency: \n \n Durability  (doesn't wear out very fast) \n \n Divisibility  (can be subdivided into smaller amounts) \n \n Limited Supply/Scarcity  (the more there is, the less it's valued) \n \n Transportability  (easily transported) \n \n Noncounterfeitability  (can't be easily duplicated/copied) \n \n \n Bitcoin fulfills  all five  of the required traits to be considered Currency. It is: \n \n Durable (numbers don't wear out) \n \n Divisible (to 8 decimal places) \n \n Limited Supply/Scarce (only 21 million may ever exist) \n \n Transportable (with the click of a button you can send bitcoins to the other side of the planet) \n \n Noncounterfeitable (based on public-key cryptography, you can't just 'copy-and-paste' more bitcoin into existence). \n \n \n These reasons are part of why some people think Bitcoin has value as Currency. But that's not all! Turning to look at Bitcoin as Money: \n Bitcoin as Money: \n For something to be used as money, it needs the three required properties of Money: \n \n Medium of Exchange  - can be compared against to determine the value of products or services during a purchase. Basically a \"common ground\" for determining value. \n \n Unit of Account  - allow us to assign values to various products and services and compare between them \n \n Store of Value  - maintain the value of a transaction over time. e.g. if you sell a car today, the money you get for it should be able to buy something of equal value 2 years later. \n \n \n Now Bitcoin  somewhat  has these characteristics: \n \n Medium of Exchange - No party can arbitrarily increase the supply on a whim. Thus, the value cannot be negatively affected by a sudden increase in supply. Thus because there is always a \"known\" amount, it can be used to compare goods and services against. \n \n Unit of Account - See above. \n \n Store of Value - Bitcoin requires effort to create. Computer churn away for long periods of time to \"mine\" bitcoin. Electricity is expended, and hardware is purchased. Thus, Bitcoin acts (somewhat) as a store or \"savings\" of labor. \n \n \n Now of course one of the biggest problems with Bitcoin being used as a Store of Value is the rapid value swings - this is bad because the car you buy one day may be worth millions of USD the next, or worth nothing, depending on the daily/hourly value of a Bitcoin. Proponents of bitcoin (myself included) hope that these swings smooth out over time as a bigger economy grows around it. But only time will tell.", "Yeah, same here.

Up to that point in my life I'd never experienced that feeling before, a sort of temporary \"money madness.\" I obviously didn't take the money and run, but the impulse was shockingly strong. \n The second time I experienced that feeling was when I first learned about Bitcoin, and it's been exacerbated with the price spikes lately. \n Just remember, beyond covering basic life stuff, more money won't make you any happier whether you have piles of it or just enough. It's just a utility for exchanging goods and services, and while I think it's great to make extra money with Bitcoin or whatever, just remember people are way more important than some extra cash. \n I really like that often-misquoted verse in the Bible, the one people incorrectly think says \"Money is the root of all evil.\" \n The verse is 1 Timothy 6:10 and it says: \n > For the   love   of money is a root of all kinds of evils.

Listen, everyone is bitching and complaining, everyone is throwing their fingers in the air, everyone is TALKING about WWE.  For every person who says \"IM DONE WATCHING WWE!\"...that's a lie for the majority of people.  Short of someone dying or becoming a drug abuser, most publicity is good publicity for an entertainment company.  Their name right now is out there more than ever because of this. \n More people want to see HHH crucified, and clearly the fans haven't given up on Dbry, as seen by the , yet again, staggering number of fingers in the air last night. \n Everyone is taking this far too seriously.  Am I annoyed Dbry didn't win the rumble? Yes, yes, yes.  Do I feel like they are possibly setting up a run of daniel bryan taking out all of the big names in a row like bowling pins and finally winning the title at WM after a series of twists and turns? Yes, yes, yes. \n That said, it also bothers me that people are ignoring the rest of the roster BECAUSE of this.  Cody and Goldy are still putting on great matches,  the shield is still selling the shit out of moves/spearing the shit out of people/some of the best in match trash talkers in the game, Khali wasn't on raw, and now that sheamus is back, you KNOW bryan is going to be the one to eliminate him at the chamber.  I imagine a scenario where Cena wins the chamber, but refuses to face Batista unless Bryan is also in the match, setting up a 3-way WM championship match that Bryan wins. \n But, who knows.  I know i'm not freaking out about it, because I don't know where creative is ACTUALLY taking this, neither do you.  There is MORE product to appreciate than just daniel bryan.  Chillax, enjoy the rest, and hope that the other boot drops by Mania. \n That said, if it ended up being Bryan vs \"The Streak\" instead of bryan in the championship match.  How would you feel about that?", "I doubt Bray will start any sort of streak. I stated in another thread, that I believe John will win by DQ, and the Wyatts will crush cena.  Thus, giving Cena a win, but making the Wyatts continue to look strong. \n Personally (fantasy booking incoming) I'd like to see them carry John out afterwards.  The next Night on Raw, after the (assumed) D-bry hullaballoo dies down, you get to a segment where Cena's music hits, and Bray comes out, chastises the fans for expecting their false prophet.....talking about how we won't have to worry about John lying to us anymore. \n So, we don't see John for a while, with no explanation, and cole does that fake serious voice \"No one has...seen John Cena for weeks, we have no word on him..etc...etc.\".  Then at Extreme Rules, Bray presumably has a match, which John Cena makes an \"unexpected\" appearance at, costs Bray the match, and then challenges him to a Cage or a HIAC match at payback.

Now here we are just two days later.....what is this /r/gaming ? \n But in all seriousness, I was trying to make the point that, Big E has opened up himself, and other people with this move, as well as causing collisions that have ended in people bleeding from the lip. Now I'm a huge Big E. fan, don't get me wrong, but he either needs to tighten that move up, if he's going to keep running through people, or stop using it. \n With all the problems the WWE has had with concussions (since they started really keeping track of them for safety) I feel like this move has a reasonable margin for head collisions.  I recall him busting his own face open on ambrose head a few months back as well. \n Regardless, they are grown ass men, and it's not going to kill them, but I'd hate to see someone go down with a concussion for a while because the move wasn't executed properly.", "Space Suit Wolverine] ( was my Hardcore Champion for a bit.

So, Sony may have some allocation left to be sold before the next \"cycle\" \n MS did (over) 1 million in 13 countries, but are sold out in all of them currently as the next \"cycle\" begins.

This item had to go from the warehouse, to someone who would mark it to be shipped, to a truck, and then moved.  In that time,  you were unable to cancel my request?

I have a hard time forming relationships due to a combination of severe depression, bouts of anxiety, hyper active tendencies, and a general lack of understanding of verbal boundaries.  (I say pretty much everything and anything that pops into my head, for better or worse).  And, finding someone who can look past that stuff, dealing with it, is not something I EXPECT other people to do, but it hurts when they can't. \n When you feel like you can't connect to people, or you feel anxiety every time you try to connect with a new person, whether it be for friendship or anything else, every let down is a much bigger disappointment than you expect it to be.  It goes from \"You know what , it's not a big deal, I'm just not her type\" to...\"I'm no ones type....I'll never find anyone\"  to \"You're never going to be good enough for anybody, you're a shitty human\"....and the thoughts sometimes can snowball and cause suicidal tendencies.  Not from one person, but from multiple experiences, and the overwhelming feeling that you're never going to be good enough for ANYONE in ANY capacity. \n In the beginning of 2013, after a 4 year relationship with someone I was going to propose to ended, I spiraled pretty bad in general. I tried to turn to friends, who kept giving me the \"I don't know what to tell you\" line.  Which is fine, they might really not known what to say, but when you're crashing, you THINK that means they don't give a shit, even if they do.   Edit: (If you have a friend in that sort of situation, instead of saying you don't know what to say, maybe invite them to do something, hang out, etc) \n So I decided I'd try to make some new friends, or meet some new people, and every time I tried, it seemed it would be a miserable failure.  People couldn't really put up with my general array of issues, that cause me to be a somewhat strange individual. After about 2 to three months of this, I remember getting up in the middle of the night and it felt like something was heavy on my chest, and I had this extreme moment of anxiety where I thought that I really was going to be alone forever, and I was a terrible person, so all of my friends must really not like me, and probably just don't know how to tell me to get out of their lives, and I tried to kill myself. \n So, anxiety about dealing with interpersonal relationships can be coupled with a lot of things, and if you know someone who has a hard time forming friendships, or is down about their inability to find a girlfriend, or just got rejected, don't just assume they can handle it as well as you (whoever you are) can.  Because if there's depression, or anxiety, or ptsd, or any other psychological issue already in play, rejection amplifies that a lot. \n Unfortunately that can lead to people doing crazy shit like that guy who just shot all those people, and that's unfortunate, but that is hardly the most likely scenario, people falling into a deeper and deeper mental hole and losing hope is more likely (on a wider scale). So if you have any friends who seem to be struggling making friendships, or relationships work, but YOU'RE friendship with them is something you value, talk to them about stuff.  I know sometimes guys are weird about talking to other guys about emotional issues, but that small gesture may help someone who's feeling devastated over something like that not working out."]}]}

Last month she brought home $22,000.00 working 40 hours per week, 15 of them at home so she is in her office less than 30 hours per week.  Great work if you can get it.  I have been going to school and completing my PhD when I made nothing except student loans for about 8 years.  In the last year I have found a job as a professor, took the Red Pill, and saved our marriage from a 10 year dead bedroom.  I agree it is extraordinarily difficult but its not like a college professor can compete with my woman on bringing it home so I can accept it.  I had to accept it because it would be ridiculous to refuse that good fortune.  Plus, my wife is what you could call a virtuous woman from the last chapter of the Book of Proverbs.  Not very passionate but the steadiest and most reliable female or male I have ever seen. \n On the other hand I am a professor and a doctor and all that and more than her intellectual equal.  I change the lives of my students, and my contribution to the zeitgeist is cutting edge and potentially important (in my own mind anyway) so I would rather compete on those things than income. \n Beyond her quiet virtues, intelligence, and exceptional foresight and business sense, the truth is, my woman is incredibly boring.  She negotiates excruciatingly exact contractual terms to comply with various federal and State statutes.  Yes, she literally reads those federal regulations we hear about all the time.

As the Captain the first thing I did was take over several chores around the house- kids homework, laundry, and dishes to start along with dinner 4 X per week.  I told my First Officer she works hard and when she gets home the only thing she should worry about is how she is going to please my cock that night.  Coming up on a year.

I think Red Pill just assumes that her name and Shit are going to the bottom of the pile anyway so they skip this.  You should not.  Seriously, get rid of everything.  If you can't bring yourself to destroy/burn it all, at least take it to somebodies attic in a different city and leave it there.  Seriously. \n 2--Slap yourself, pinch yourself, snap a rubber band, burn yourself with a lighter, spray a foul odor whatever- just be sure it is unpleasant or aversive- EVERY SINGLE TIME you start to think about her.  If you mark a cheek or an arm, switch to the other side. \n 3--Get busy doing other things that do not permit you time to think about her.  Ideally this would include practicing cold approaches.  Your best solution is PUA/Plate Spinning combined with going to the gym and other self improvement.  Get Brown Belt in Karate.  Take up Mixed Martial Arts.  Start a business.

My economics teacher had literally nothing for us to do, as Seniors' schedule was not changed due to snow days, and we had finished all exams the week before. So we were going to spend the last few days watching movies. People would bring in their dvds and the class would vote on what to watch, fair enough. We had 3-4 days so with 45 minute class we could easily get through a 2 hour~ movie. \n Anyways, somehow we decided upon The Day After Tomorrow. Works for me, standard disaster movie. After the first day however, this extremely sheltered girl in our class who was homeschooled until high school (very religious conservative parents, didnt do any extra curricular, barely talked, ect) apparently went home and cried to her mother that the movie was too violent. \n Well her mother is essentially Kyle's Mom from Southpark. Huge bitch (literally) that would go on a rampage against anything she deemed offensive. She called the principal, eventually taking this conversation to the superintendent level. Meanwhile at school we did nothing in that class for a day because the teacher didnt want to start a different movie, and we still had nothing to do. Because its really not worth arguing over because its a goddamn stupid thing to argue, the district folded to th mothers damands for only \"healthy family friendly movies\" or something similar. This translates to: \"You must watch what my daughter wants.\" She picked Cars. As a 17~ year old in highschool she picked Cars as the movie to watch. I know its not a bad movie, but it just struck me as odd because the absurdity we had to go through. \n In the end we took up the next 2 days watching 2/3 of Cars, all in awkward silence the entire time. I literally dont even remember the movie, I just kind of zoned out starring at the back of the projector. We still swap stories about how absurd it was. \n The lengths overprotective parents go to to shelter their kids is astounding. Also, update on the girl, her name was Sarah and she actually got knocked up by a boy (Cant recall his name, he was a Dominoes driver though) and she kept the kid. Havent heard of the father since. Only reason I know that is \"friend of a friend\" type story through Facebook.", "Well first off. The movie says the Purge Day saved \"the economy.\" The movies logic was all the \"undesirables\" (ie: homeless) needed to be removed, and society found a way. \n However, in reality our financial system is muuuuuuuuch more complicated than that, with welfare/social service \"mooches\" being only a tiny fraction of the issue. \n Next, the Neighborhood. The family that stars lives in a very wealthy area, its shown that they have all sorts of security, checkpoints, gated fences. \n Somehow the villains just waltz right in unopposed. Even if no one was there to stop them, theres plotwise nothing to keep random bumkin with a shotgun from blasting them en route. The villain crew was mostly armed with knives and blades, I think they had a few pistols, but whatever. \n The SUPER INDESTRUCTO SECURITY SYSTEM the family uses is easily thwarted. On top of having a big ARM/DISARM button in an easy to reach place, the villains defeat it with pickups and steel chains. If you unstoppable iron curtain of protection is beaten by a rusty truck and some teenagers with knives, its not very good. Also doesnt address you could just get some gasoline and burn the damn house down (cause crime is legal and stuff). \n The wife and son are standard issue horror movie idiocy. Dont listen, do the opposite of what told, wander aimlessly/get caught. The husband is the only one with conviction, but constantly fails to protect his family because  emotions . \n Lastly, and worst. At the end of the day, sun rising, the nightmare over. They let the villains go. They killed most, but they let the ringleader and survivors go. They give them some \"we dont want to part of the madness, we arent like you\" speech. Well thats all fun and good. But that doesnt fucking stop him. He just goes home and plots his revenge for next year. You'd have to up and move, restart your life, theres nothing to  keep  him from coming back and getting revenge, aside from some kind gestures. \n Also the movies fails to address the massive psychological impact of THE PURGE.

I had the thing for 6 hours (minimum time I was allowed to rent for, whatever) and it only took me about 3 to clean my house. There's this elderly couple that live 2 houses down and the wife was walking her dog. They are in good health for a couple in their 70s, but not that good of health. I offered to clean their gutters out when I finished, seeing as I had the ladder for another couple hours and had nothing better to do. \n The woman was delighted, couldnt thank me enough. So I grab my things, walk on over to their house, and begin my work. Well the wife drove off to do something, and I'm all by myself on the roof. The husband, having no knowledge of this arrangement, comes home. He sees me on the roof and starts yelling at me at the top of his lungs. He's  slightly  senile, and apparently had no idea who I was, even after I told him my name and pointed out I live 2 houses down. \n He keeps screaming, saying I'm trying to rob his house, shouting obscenities, fun stuff. I keep trying to explain and he decides he's heard enough of it. He takes my ladder down (I could still get off the roof safely, but whatever, I'm kind of pissed now) and runs inside to call the police. At this point I'm just sitting on the roof flabbergasted, and I can here him continue to insult me from inside the house. \n Well the police show up about 10 minutes later, I wasnt going anywhere, since I'd need to explain wtf was going on anyways. Cops arent dumb, and they can clearly see I'm in no shape to rob the house from the roof (because Ironclad gloves, a couple scrapers, a big metal bucket, and dirty work clothes are the go to attire of a master thief). They prop the ladder back up and I climb my way down. After about 5 minutes of explaining myself (to which I am still being yelled at by the old man) his wife returns to see this commotion. Her husband asks if she knew about this and she responds \"Oh yes, /u/Lord_Niteshade offered to help clean the gutters since he was already doing his houses'\" Husband had a look of total shock on his face, and the police had complete looks of disapproval. In the end I didnt get very far on that gutter job, I packed my things and walked back home. Best part is when the old man threw the ladder over it apparently smashed on his driveway just right.

Such is life."]}, {"subreddit": "totalwar", "posts": ["It is. But I warn you its not for the feint of heart. \n Basic rundown of major changes. \n 1: I cant understand shit. \n Everything is written in native languages, so expect lots of latin, greek, and barbarian gibberish. English (or 6 other translated languages) context are available as well. So names look like \"Romani Equites Companiani\" (Roman Allied Companion Cavalry) \n On top of this all unit voices (except speeches, those are hardcoded) are replaced by actual dialogue of historians speaking the language. Can be confusing initially. \n 2: Economy. \n Its very very very  Very  slow. Taxes are much more of your income than most mods, and buildings take realistic lengths of time to build (read: years/decades). A massive forum or a mine or harbor may take upwards of 20-30+ turns.  Armies also cost far more expensive and have much higher upkeep. High end units are typically 3000+ recruitment, 600-1k+ upkeep. Ships are also massively expensive and take long times to build (because a \"unit\" of ships represents a fleet). This makes maintaining large armies much harder to maintain. You cant expect a half stack of good troops in every city like RTW. Most areas are garrisoned by shitty regional troops, while your professional armies of real units are busy driving into enemy lands. It also makes times of peace more important. Some factions (like Egypt or Rome) are lucky. Their homelands are relatively safe, and can focus economically. Other factions like Gauls or Selucia, not so much. They face constant outsider pressure and rarely get the necessary time to expand. \n 3: Combat. \n Its slower than RTW vanilla, but not crazy slow. Its more or less same speed as RS2 or RTR. There are like 700 new units, so they mix it up. Naval combat is also made more important by difficulty of constructing ships, their massive cost, and low availability of cheap natural harbors. Overall this area is least changed mechanically, althrough the AI, noticably the siege ai, is much imporoved (expect bigger sieges with lots more siegeworks used. I've been fighting the span \n 4: Buildings. I already said they take longer. But they also radically changed them from vanilla. \n Military buildings are now unified. No more stables/practice range/barracks. Instead theres two kinds of military buildings. One for regional troops and one for native troops. Native barracks take much longer to build, and can only be made in specific provinces. From here you recruit \"your\" soldiers. As in, Rome can recruit Hestati for example. Regional barracks recruit local soldiers from the conquered populace. This allows say, Rome, to recruit Celtic forces from conquered Gaul territory, but is unable to build roman troops. \n Government types. Each territory needs a kind of government. They range from 1 to 4 type. Type 1 is a homeland, your factions historic seat of power. For example Rome has italia, Egypt has the Nile area. From these regions you can build your best troops and best buildings, if you have a type I government. On the opposite end, Type 4 is an allied state. Effectively a puppet/client kingdom. Its more or less autonomous, as the people keep their culture and freedom. It can only train local troops, and Roman generals form your family will actually  anger  the populace. Instead you need to recruit then instill a puppet governor of the local culture. This can have bad consequences when disloyal puppets get dreams of conquest. \n New Buildings. EB adds lots of new buildings like River Ports, Military Ports (ports are now split into two kinds, one purely economic, one purely military, I believe cities must pick which kind), and LOTS of unique buildings. Seriously, nearly every province has unique structures. Most are landmarks, some are buildings or monuments. I've seen the Tomb of Kings, Monuments to gods, ancient wonders, important mountains or lakes, ruins from even older civilizations, lots of stuff. Most give minor bonuses, but some are quite powerful. Generally you can tear them down too, which nets lots of money but angers the locals. \n 5: Traits. Entire trait system was redone, including a personality system. Generals can be Sharp/Dull, Charismatic/Uncharismatic, Energetic/Languorous, as well as Optimist/Pessimist, Generous/Selfish, and Loyal/Disloyal. These all play into how they gain traits. For example a pessimistic general is more likely to be discouraged in a siege, acquire traits like drunkeness or anger, where an Optimist will be more likely to rise the occasion. Sometimes being \"bad\" is good. A generous man can make a poor administrator, or an unselfish man cant cope with sending so many men to their deaths. \n Theres elected officers for most factions (notably rome), various houses of nobles, tribes, or citizen classes that affect traits. There army morale and weather conditions, and overall hundreds of new traits.", "fix the AI \n Old misnomer. Darthmod doesnt actually \"fix\" AI. This is a farce. Multiple TW mod teams have discussed and come to the conclusion the core AI cannot be accessed to modify. The older titles simply do not have the dev tools available. Its possible on Shogun II, but no one has actually figured it out. \n Now, what does happen on the older games is you can adjust some of the parameters of the AI. You can change how quickly they react to movement, formations and spacing, you can change what units they'll dictate to tasks like flanking, and you can address army composition. But you cant add new AI. \n So", "The only reason I could ever see for getting mercs is if you desperately need more troops for a single linchpin battle. A huge siege or massively outnumbered attack. \n After the fight you disband them, so you arent stuck with the upkeep costs. Otherwise they just dont seem economical in any sense. If you are rich enough that upkeep isnt an issue, you are rich enough to just buy better units to stuff in your armies, so it creates a paradox where theres no scenario where mercs are useful for long periods. You're either too poor to afford them, or if you are rich, you're rich enough to buy better units than the mercenaries.", "Western Roman Empire is widely regarded as the hardest faction in any TW. \n Heres the summary: \n \n Lots of territory. This is not a good thing, your empire stretches across most of Europe and its difficult to defend all sides. \n \n Surrounded by enemies. There are literally a dozen powerful barbarian tribes camped out on your borders ready to tear up your empire. Worse, eventually Roman Rebels or the Eastern Empire will bring powerful Roman units against you. And some of your enemies get hordes (huge free armies with no upkeep) \n \n Terrible infrastructure. Given the size and population of your cities, your infrastructure is terrible. You have few good recruitment regions, bad roads, and terrible trade compared to your eastern counterparts. Your richest regions in Italy and Iberia hardly compare to the wealth of Greece, Anatolia, and the middle east. \n \n Overpopulation. Your cities are far too large for their buildings to support. Virtually every city is unhappy and hemmoraging money from corruption. You  will  need to tactically abandon some unholdable regions to later recapture. \n \n Religious unrest. The first TW with full blown religious mechanics, and the WRE gets slapped across the face. Your empire is a mesh of Paganism and Christianity. Your generals are also of both faiths and as a result many regions are under severe religious unrest. The many Barbarians near you are also pagan in nature, and converting every city to a unified faith takes time and money you dont have. \n \n Terrible Generals. You start with some of  the  worst generals and governors in any game. Many have terrible degenerative traits like cowardice, alcoholism, or idiocy. Its better to have some of them killed just so you can adopt new ones. This is a far cry from the ERE, which has several potentially great generals, and far fewer terrible ones. \n \n Units. Your units are powerful, but expensive. This means you will have difficulty fielding armies early and will seriously need to weigh in each purchase. Your cavalry is also severely lacking compared to the ERE, and if the Huns or other cavalry heavy factions attack you, you have few good counters. \n \n Diplomacy. You start with terrible relations with almost every faction bordering you, save for your allies the ERE. It will be difficult to forge alliances and even trade agreements sometimes. You have a huge target on your forehead and no one feels like negotiating. \n \n Finances. You are fucking poor. You will go negative for much of the early game, at least until you can reconsolidate and build up. The only good way to make money is sacking cities, because your trade and taxes are horrible from poor diplomacy and high corruption. \n \n \n So", "In Medieval II its whatever your best sword+shield melee unit is. Usually this is a knight of some kind [Dismounted English/Imperial Knights for example]. They have very high armor, strong melee, and high morale. Hopefully the troops on the other side are of weaker stock [like ranged units] and will quickly rout. \n In Rome this is largely the same. High ranking \"roman cohort\" style units work best, so Urban/Praetorian Cohorts, Silver Shield Legionaires, etc. Im not sure what the shirtless barbarians should use, since most of their units are low armor high morale. \n Mercenary or low armor units are about the worst units to send up the walls. They usually have low morale and terrible armor, which means they tend to get cut down on the approach by archers/crossbows/muskets, or they suffer too many losses in the brutal melee on the walls and get cut down."]}, {"subreddit": "asoiaf", "posts": ["Even if there more eggs, they won't be relevant in time.

Not sure when actual work began, but in Oct 2008 they had a working demo for Gameinformer to play, so that says a lot. \n I think the problem is Gearbox dedicated all or too much of its collective resources to Borderlands 2. That makes sense from a business standpoint. BL2 was basically \"free money\" if they didnt fuck it up. Strong community, overwhelming hype, almost entirely positive feedback. And it paid off. Borderlands 2 sold very well and was very well received. Meanwhile Aliens had been put on the backburner for  years  and likely stagnated in developement. At some point they decided they could not reasonably finish it, and contracted work out to TimeGate (or some similar scenario).

This means forests can be chopped down as a quick \"burst\" of production in a pinch. This can be useful if you are trying to get a wonder and are scrapping out ever last drop of production to beat the AI. \n But, heres the rub. Long term you could have left that forest be, and instead put a lumber mill on it. So this would create production over the long haul. If a city was low in hills or other high production tiles it might have wanted those forests intact, to serve as lumber mills to help offset its low production potential. \n Or, maybe you want them for less obvious reasons. Some civs have unique units or abilities that favor forests'/jungles. Examples being the aztec jaguar (bonus movement and combat in jungles/forests), the Iroquois (use forest tiles as roads), or the Celts (forests make faith). \n Second part of that is jungles. Generally speaking you do not want to chop these down, like, ever. Exceptions being you really need the hill underneath, or if it covers a resource. Jungles make science with universities, give the same food value as grasslands, give culture with the \"sacred path\" pantheon, and can have trade posts built in them (for more science/gold). They also dont give you anything when cut down, just waste time and energy. \n So", "Dead on. \n Late game theres so many more ways to get happiness. Early game you are basically dependent on luxuries for happiness, with only minimal amounts coming from other sources (social policies, religion, buildings). \n Late game you have many social policies, and most likely a well established religion. Both can give plenty of happiness. On top of that you likely have a large empire with many luxuries, or many city states under your boot, (or both!) making your dependence on foreign trade less so. To top it off, theres the happiness buildings. Because happiness is global, I can make a new city with one population, and stuff a Collisuem, Theater, Stadium, etc into it to offset the happiness of my 20 population city.", "AI has always been stupid in Civ. \n Always . \n There's simply  too much  for it to do. \n The only reason the AI's empire doesnt always collapse from neglect is they get a massive (+20, iirc) happiness boost,  and  they cant suffer negative happiness. In older civs AI were less prone to or immune to those game's version's of the happiness (or corruption) mechanic. \n Then there's combat. Simply put the AI has a very limited grasp of strategy. You would think Civ would be easier to program combat AI for. Combat is turn based, doesnt require instant adjustment to strategy, and there are finite possible movements per turn. It should not be terribly difficult to make an AI that can fight appropriately right? I mean, it should be easier than Total War where unit placement and flanking are crucial, or StarCraft where quick reactions and micromanagement are key. \n Wrong. The combat AI has gotten worse since StacksOfDoom were replaced. With stacks, the AI could throw its weigh around better. Since there was little strategic depth beyond \"My stack smash ur stack\" the AI's superior production capabilities (which are a direct result of AI handicaps) allowed it to field armies that threatened players. Now that stacks are dead and 1 Unit Per Tile is king, the AI cant compensate. It doesnt even understand basic techniques like Melee-Front, Ranged-Rear. It just moves units according to their pathing and hopes a target wanders into range. \n The AI is also totally incapable of grand level thinking. It doesnt \"plan an empire\". It doesnt have build orders, long term goals, or often even fit it's civ's playstyle. It isnt capable of designating certain cities to certain production types. It just churns out whatever it needs at that moment, and often spams new cities without a second thought. If players behaved like the AI they would quickly fall apart at the hands of economic bankruptcy (which causes science stagnation), and unhappiness causing revolts. \n The Diplomacy AI is an entirely different matter. It is less thought, and more calculation. For all intents and purposes, every diplomatic action with an AI carries a numeric value of Good or Bad. Things like Adopted your Religion peacefully, Forgave them for Spying, and Traded Recently are all positive numbers. Things like Warmonger, Denounced, and Caught Spying are negative. The AI merely adds up the total on its various diplomatic traits with you. If it hits certain thresholds, this dictates how it reacts to your demands. \n The other issue is the AI puts entirely too much stock into how important Military strength is. A strong (but not warmongering) military ensures you make friends with the whole world. But a peacefully nation with a small/no military will be openly attacked by everyone. The AI is not trying to make friends, its just in it to win. Its calculation decides My Military > His Military, and off to war it goes. Rational thought is not included. There are a  few  \"human-like\" tactics that were programmed into the diplo AI. It will frequently make friendships, only to use that time to build up an army and attack. It will make research agreements to drain treasury and then declare war, or it will ask for lots of gold, then immediately use the gift to buy an army. These events are usually telegraphed from a mile away once you learn the nuances of the AI.", "Si. \n Science is the god resource, so a science civ can outpace the other civs in any aspect. Theoretically. \n Oh, you're a warmonger civ? Well that'd be cool if Mr Science didnt field more advanced units. \n Oh, you are religious? Well thats cool but I have higher tech, I build better religious buildings than you can currently. \n The problem science civs run into is if they are denied the option to prosper. Constant being at war and forcing them to build units not buildings, or making them hated by all so they cant trade or get research agreements slows stops them dead in their tracks.", "There are two things that cause AI to become unnecessarily hostile. \n The first is their AI. Each AI has different traits that dictate how it likes to act and respond. Some AIs are just hardwired to be assholes. Generally the biggest asshole either wins at war and gets huge, or pisses off the wrong people and gets exterminated. \n The other reason is the diplomacy biases. If an AI hates you for a myriad of reasons, like believing you are a warmonger, you being friends with someone they hate, or being mad at you for converting their cities (to name a few), they STAY mad. AI doesnt know how to tuck its tail between its legs and run. The closest thing is the AFRAID status, which can be difficult to make certain AIs cower in fear. As a result, the AI will sit on its tiny nation of rage, and keep pissing off whoever its mad at. Eventually a stronger AI decides they like the angry AIs land, or that its army is weak, and put them out of their misery."]}, {"subreddit": "gaming", "posts": ["I played it at launch.

This goes back to ME as a series constantly having writers flip flopped around. In ME1 they are a black ops group that went rogue because they \"dont play by the rules.\" So we expect a small group of elite soldiers, maybe some scientists, and a few outposts or whatever. This is more or less accurate. \n In ME2 they pseudo-retconned them into a secret society/criminal network. They get funding from a number of powerful groups and corporations they either own, embezzle from, or bribe/extort. Their exact power is never clearly expressed and we can only assume how far TIM's web of contacts and associates reaches. We do learn in ME3 it even includes powerful figures like Udina, who is one of the most powerful political figures in the universe. \n Anyways, in ME2 it was explained the Normandy SR2 and the Lazarus Project were both  extremely  expensive endeavors. They cost billions of credits in research, materials, and workers, using the best minds and resources at Cerberus' disposal. TIM clearly had a massive interest in the project's success or he wouldnt have bankrolled such an enormous budget. While it's clear this expense isnt enough to endanger Cerberus's power or financial standing, its no doubt a massive blow to their resources. Losing that station likely didnt help either. \n Now come ME3 Cerberus is again supercharged by the power of new writers. They wanted a 3 faction war, but Cerberus from ME2 just doesnt fit the bill. So once again they made them plot stronger. They got entire fleets of ships (enough that entire alliance fleets were needed to assault their base), outposts and bases on virtually every planet, some massive in size. They had an entire planet of recruits and who knows how many active personnel. Lastly they had a budget that had to have rivaled entire species' economies, given they can afford to operate so many assets, from their ships, bases, labs, soldiers, and staff. \n Each incarnation of Cerberus tips more and more to the \"evil because evil\" side of the spectrum.

This level of mystery and the fact he is so enigmatic made him at least interesting. We wanted some form of closure on why he is and what he wants. Even when you have betrayed and ignored him at every chance, he still acts like he's the chessmaster with everything going to plan. \n Come ME3 we learn he just wanted to loot the collector base for anything Reaper tech he could use. Not sure why the dead Reaper wasnt sufficient for him, since its an entire Reaper, not a partially formed larva. The Collector tech is likely more or less useless to him, as its partially organic and made from ex-Protheans. We also learn TIM's ultimate goal is to \"control reapers\" in a Bond villainesque sense. He's just too absurd to take seriously as a character anymore. He lost what little mystery he had from ME2 thanks to writing cliches. He lost appeal at that point. He was also a repeat of Saren's character. \"I am bad, but I do evil with good intentions, however this ultimately comes back to haunt me and spells my demise.

Only Asari mating is possible, because that uses their mind meld thing, rather than a sperm+egg system like most organics. \n The other scenario would be, assuming magically humans+X can breed into some kind of horrific mutant, it would be sterile. I have no idea how such different morphologies would combine. Turians/Quarian arent even based on the same type of chemical biology (dextro-amino acids vs levo-amino acids) so they cant mix with humans on a chemical level. As for Krogan/Drell/Hanar/Vorcha/Batarian/Everyone else, even if it somehow \"worked\", the result would be some hideous abomination of primate and reptile, or worse.", "History agrees with me. Arguably the happiest we've seen any nation post war is the US in WWII. They however, were one of the few countries not bombed into the stone age or otherwise inflicted untold civilian loses. \n In Mass Effect, entire planets are essentially scorched earth (pun!). Totally ignoring all story input, Earth, Palaven, Thessia, Irune, and Dekuuna, Khar'Shan, and the Citadel itself are all heavily damaged, bombed out, or otherwise suffering extreme losses. Thats the homeworlds of almost every major species and the heart of galactic government. The \"Survivor's Joy\" of not dying to Reapers would quickly wear off, and be replaced with a galactic sense of Survivor's Guilt. Many civilian and military personel alike would ask the question \"Why Me? Why did I live?\" and there would be monumental levels of PTSD. At least assuming most species operate on an emotional level similar to humans. \n I'd guess Turians are less effected by despair, given their civic duty based culture. They would likely focus on the immediate task of restoring Palaven, then the tasks of keeping peace (if Destroy/Synthesus) and rebuilding. Krogans would likely not suffer any emotional rebounds, as they have a war culture. They'd look to the War as having caused only positives for them. Genophage cure (in most outcomes), new levels of respect (in most outcomes) or at minimum it knocked the other species down a few pegs, as Krogan loses are minimal. The other species I would assume all go through a lot of emotional shit, especially among civilian population that were evacuated very early or civilians that survived Reaper occupation.", "1: Infinite Plot Resources. \n Its never explained how he gets his funding. Its assumed they have some wealthy donators, investors, and a few fake companies, but come on. They spend retarded amounts in RnD. \n In ME3 they somehow had all their base and labs, Indoctrination Nation Army, developed Power Armor for their soldiers in apparently 6 months (I sure as fuck didnt see it in ME1/2) and had enough ships and fleets to threaten colonies, attack the Citadel, and stall an Alliance fleet. At one point in the campaign I decided \"fuck we should have gotten these guys to help, apparently they kick the Alliances' ass.\" \n 2: Plot Strength. \n In ME1 Cerberus are just an ex-black ops group. Ok, high end personnel, some cool tech, and some funding. In ME2 they seem more like a very secret organization with a lot of money, and a few secret bases. But not much else, as they seem to lack the massive personnel influx in ME3 (Hell they needed shitty mechs to protect their stations). Come ME3 they went full blown comic book evil army. Evil bases on every other planet? Check. Legions of soldiers and infinite plot logistics to support them? Check. Endless supply of resources for fiendishly outlandish technology to thwart the heroes? Check. They are Mass Effect's A.I.M., HYDRA, COBRA, or Legion of Doom. \n 3: Illusive Man is a badly written Character \n You cannot make a \"chess master\" character unless you have the entire story planned out. Illusive Man was designed as such, but I highly doubt they had a cohesive idea for 2/3 written down. He comes off as pulling information out of his ass, again, only because the plot demands it. His magical foresight seems to be purely the result of bad writing. Also, Shepard interacting with him is poorly written. For ME2 you just smile and nod while he tells you what to do. This is  COMMANDER FUCKING SHEPARD  hero of the Skylian Blitz, Decorated Alliance Officer, first Human Spectre. And you just sit there and take orders from Dr. No? On the few times you do disobey TIM \"its ok, he knew you'd do that.\" Oh well shit? Why did he even need Miranda to consider putting a control chip in Shepard. He could just divine the outcome anyways, good thing she never went along with that. \n 4: He's Single Minded and Indoctrinated \n TIM always has 1 fucking goal. Power by any means. In ME2 I guess his ultimate goal was the Collector base/the tech within. Saving colonies/humans was just a front to lure in Shepard and remove a threat. In ME3 his goal is manipulating Indoctrination to serve him, then becomes flat out Control the Reapers. However, the story basically tells you he's Indoctrinated. Yet his Indoctrination is  nothing  like Saren or Benezia's. He seems to be totally unchanged. Hell, he physically allows things that very much defy the reaper's will, such as his Sanctuary Indoctrination research labs. The Reapers in no way would allow an Indoctrinated servant to create this, it does nothing to further their goals or plans. Hell, they destroy it out of concern of what it may do. TIM however, as usually \"expected that all along hur hur.\" How? How does 1 guy outwit ancient Cthulu's that are far beyond the scope of human minds? He doesnt. A writer does. TIM is just a one dimensional all knowing chess master that is badly crammed into the plot to be an \"ominous force of control and doom.\"", "I'll say this much: the end of the trilogy makes sequels really tricky. \n Ding. Correct. \n This is the main issue with a sequel, of any distance in the future. The endings (just assume Destroy/Control/Robotize) alone are too problematic. Too much changes between them for one unified sequel. BW wont and cant justify making huge swaths of story available only for those specific endings. Its content only 30% of players will see, and massive amounts of the game could need to be rewritten. \n Then you have all the major choices. Who died, who lived, who did you save, and who did you betray? This could all theoretically be included, but it would be a big undertaking. Theres tons of options even without one narrative. Take the Genophage. Going in with Wrex, or Wreav creates two almost totally different scenarios. One creates a Krogan looking to rebuild and restore what they'd lost. The other creates an unshackled race of monsters ready to get revenge on a weakened galaxy. These arent the kind of differences you can offhandedly write out in a few lines of dialogue. \n Then theres all the minor choices. These are the easiest to include. All the minor people helped, the conversations had, the deeds done. These can all fade into lore, be forgotten, or simply be recalled as war stories or history lessons. All it likely requires is some altered dialogue. Shepard did X, vs Shepard did Y."]}, {"subreddit": "atheism", "posts": ["If  that scenario were true, it just goes back to the Epicurus quote.

They didn t have the means to, but still they believed that another entinty is behind the Lightning, the Volcano or other awesome stuff happening around them. \n So, looking at a picture like this, the fact that we ve never seen something similar before should trigger our defenses. In parallel we all know that our bones are covered in soft tissue which would harldy cause any damage to wood especially since a human is not heavy enough. Lastly, wood does not act this way. It has a certain elasticity and a breaking point. \n So now that we questioned it, what can we do to draw our conclusions? One means is to conduct an experiment. Of course we wont stand on the same spot for thirty years. \n What we can do is lay our eyes on our very own house or any house with a wooden floor. Such houses have furniture. They have pianos. Pianos that weight way more than a monk. Pianos that have been standing still for as many years or more or less. We also have other furniture that apply much more pressure on wooden floors in smaller surfaces yet, nobody has ever experienced something like this before. \n So this wall of text that nobody will bother to read has some scary conclusions. This is not just an overaction of something that people should not even have to bother to analyse. This is not about wood and abrasive wear. This is about human nature. A group of people, a LARGE group of people mind you lack the common sense to analyze such a simple scenario. Adults. People taking responsible decisions. Voters. People who should be discussing politics, economy. How to fix the world. These are the facebook sharers, the Like Lifesavers, the Reality TV watchers...the  decision makers. Go on facebook now. Look. THey are your friends. Your family. Your mother. The hive mind. \n THey are manipulated. They are the NAZI snitches who tell the NAZIs where the jews are hiding. \n Humanity is 200.000 years old. The NAZI crime didn t happen in the third world in some small African village thousands of years ago. They happened on a national scale in the West 50 years ago. And they will happen again. \n Because of people like that. Because common sense is not all that common. Because the 500 people who upvoted that thing (or the hundreds of people that upvote it everytime) are just lucky they were born now instead of 50 years ago in NAZI germany."]}]}

There are 22 starters. Let's not forget that he WENT TO THE WORST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE, yet people want to say \"he went 6-10, the kid isn't a leader\". The kid can't carry the team by himself. He's passed for 4000 yards and rushed for 700 yards in his first two seasons, EACH. He's passed for more yards than anyone in the NFL in his first two years. All this with a pretty average receiving corps. I'm so tired of this crap. People wanted the kid to fail so bad, when they were so blatantly wrong they said \"the NFL will figure him out\"--because, you know, QBs usually get worse than their rookie year. Sure, he started off a bit slow this year, but then he was excellent the 2nd half the season, going 7 consecutive games without a pick. It also doesn't help that the Panthers have had the toughest schedules in the league the past couple years, and their offensive coordinator fell in love with the read option bullshit. He either called some read option crap or a 40 yd pass down field(to our average at best receivers, btw), good fucking riddance. Considering the position he's been put in he's gone above and beyond expectation, and it just burns people's ass that they were so wrong about the kid. Who would yo rather have Cam Newton as the #1 pick or Christian Ponder at #10 or whatever you got him at? Give me a break. I suppose next you're going to argue Ponder is better because he had more wins.", "May I point out...that Cam has better numbers than Luck in every category? and than all the other \"young guns\" QB list that he's constantly left out of?(Aside from Russell Wilson). Yet he's just now getting a  little  recognition...ESPN first take's acknowledgement of Cam's lights out play is questioning whether he is worthy of finally being mentioned with those other young guns...when he has had superior numbers to them on lesser teams since day 1, but especially this year. \nNot where he is on that list, but whether he was even worth mentioning...lol\nPeople really pretend Luck and Kaep and Rg3 do things Cam hasn't done, or make throws or runs that Cam hasn't already, that he is so far behind them...alas, I suppose it comes down to the whole \"wins\" argument. The media and casual fans simplify everything a player does into one easy to understand stat, the problem being that no one player can influence that outside of maybe Peyton Manning in certain years of his career.", "I find it interesting that Cam has had the best stats of all the young gun QBs for his whole career--even discounting his rookie season--He's had the best numbers since last year by a good margin(Wilson and RG3 had superior passer ratings with a much smaller volume of passes and while Cam threw downfield about twice as much, Luck threw for a few more yards but Newton crushed him in every other category in his rookie and sophmore seasons), when he supposedly had a \"sophmore slump\".\n Yet pure stats never mattered then. Cam was just padding stats, or they didn't mean anything because he wasn't winning(not his fault). No one cared about stats then. \n Now when Wilson has finally surpassed Newton for what may be a short period(Cam had better numbers than Luck and Wilson in every category just 2-3 weeks ago, it was posted on r/nfl actually) by a pretty slim margin, stats are the end all be all and prove that Wilson is better. \n I think it's pretty clear Wilson also has a much better team and a much better coach. As bad as Wilson's Oline is, Carolina's is just as bad, maybe even worse. They're currently starting a guy who was a DT just a month ago at LG. People think we still have a good Oline because of Jordan Gross and Ryan Kalil. Gross is aging, and our other 3 players on the Oline are horrific, especially now that w have lost 4-5 guards for the season. Their receiving targets and Oline are probably a wash, but Seattle is pretty much superior in every other category. \n All that being said, I'm not sure who is better, Wilson or Cam. Wilson is truly incredible and I see him do things Cam can't do, on the same note, I can say the same thing about Cam as well. I slightly lean toward Cam because I believe his potential is unmatched/he is a better runner(Wilson seems more of a scrambler than a runner)/I'm a panther fan. But objectively I think it's a pretty much a toss us. \n I think it's rather hypocritical for people to suddenly cite stats on why Wilson is better(you're not that only one) when it never mattered before.", "I used to think fumble recoveries were dumb luck too. But then I noticed that a lot of times players have more than more than 1 recovery/forced and it kind of reveals a pattern. Having the ability to always be in the right spot at the right time IS a tangible skill that makes some athletes great. In football I think it's called a ball hawk(although usually it's about DBs ability to go get the ball, but not always), in soccer there are super star strikers who's main talent is just being there to clean up rebounds and score em aka \"poachers\" like Javier Hernandez, in basketball they call it a \"glue guy\" or \"garbage man\" or simply \"guy has hustle\".", "No..simply having better hands does not mean a receiver is automatically better. Tehre are more attributes to a WR's success than simply hands. That's like saying a WR who's faster is better. T.O. had terribly inconsistent hands, but since he excelled at pretty much everything else,  he parlayed that into becoming one of the best receivers of all time. \n Lafell is faster, younger(thus has a lot more potential), coming off his best season(Avant coming off his worst), bigger, more agile. Lafell isn't an \"okay\" blocker, he was one of the better blocking WRs in te league. \nHonestly Lafell may be the better player, period. \n Frankly you sound bitter and like one of the Panter fans who blindly hated LAfell. The dude wasn't a star and pissed me off plenty over the years but he was a 3rd round pick, and has pretty much lived up to that. He's not a terrible receiver by any means, he's just not the game breaking #2 we all hoped he would. \n There's a better chance of Avant goign Hixon on us than Lafell does of \"sucking\" on the Patriots. In that offense, with Brady? Avant is a potentially washed up possession receiver. It's great he can catch anything thrown at him--but can he still shake DBs?, he's never been a reliable YAC receiver and his numbers have been on the decline, he's not even remotely a deep threat, etc. \n That being said Avant is coming much cheaper than Lafell in NE, and Avant is a tough veteran so I'm on board wit it, but also not expecting a whole lot."]}, {"subreddit": "panthers", "posts": ["I was firmly in the neutral camp as far as gettleman goes until the last few weeks. It seems like people either hate the man or can do no wrong. There seems to be very few people in the middle. As I said I've been in the middle but I'm starting to lean to the  anti gettleman side because this guy has made a lot of bad decisions. \n People keep saying \"this is hurneys mess\" and \"cash strapped\". The problem with this is A) everyone seems to be completely fine crowning as a genius because we went 12-4 with a team that was built by hurney for the most part, except a few role players. You can't say all his faults are hurneys but give him all the credit for a team Burney built. \nB) people seem to forget we signed hardy for 13 fucking million dollars. We were not as cash strapped as people like to portray. You know how much we could have gotten for that? I don't blame him for hardy being gone, he can't foresee that--but spending 13 mil a year on one player while claiming you're cleaning a salary cap mess seems rather....nonsensical--especially when you're fielding maybe the worst oline and secondaries in the league. He neglected protecting and equipping our franchise qb w weaponry, only to put that money into a position we alreadY put 70+ mill into. Even if hardy played this year.\npeople claim he had no other choice but to roll with chandler and bell? Are you fucking joking? Jared veldheer was on the market and was signed for about 1/3 of what we signed hardy for(annually). Hell, if we didn't sign harper and decoud, their combined salary is a little more than veldheer makes even. He tried this bargain bin bullshit and failed miserably. Money aside--the fact that he simply didn't even TRY to protect our franchise qb is deplorable. Didn't draft anyone, didn't sign anyone, hell he could have traded a draft pick for a respectable tackle. So when people say he had no other choice..I just here apologists who hold on to this dream that he is some genius. It reminds me of how all of us thought rivera was some pragmatic bad ass when we first signed him as coach. Gettleman appears very flawed and seems to have done a lot more harm than good so far. Signing a couple role players out of the bargain bin that worked out (but nothing really major) and drafting star (no brainer) does not a genius gm make. Sure kawann short and benwikere look good bUT after 13 draft picks, are 2 good players and 2 potentially good players thst really that high a success rate? \n This is all before we get to him getting into a pissing contest with the franchise's greatest player and running him out of town--where he is flourishing once again. This move also saved us no money, as we are still paying him about 7 mill this year.  Another terrible move, especially with how lacking our wr corps is, and how a pair of smitty and benjamin would be an incredible combo thst would possibly mitigate some of our offensive issues.\noh yeah and Jordan gross hinted at the fact that his retirement had something to do w the new sheriff in town. \n It's utterly shocking that he let this team fall apart like this...we were 12-4 last season, sure I didn't expect a repeat of that--but we are in the bottom third in the league, lead the league in getting blown out,  and our franchise qb is getting utterly murdered every weAK with arguably the worst supporting Cast in the nfl. That is on gettleman. Not hurney.  Also, another point for the \"we have no money\" crowd--no decent teams have money. Every fucking team is fucking cash strapped. That is the way it is. You know what teams aren't cash strapped? The jags. The raiders. The browns. The bills. The titans. Notice a trend here?  Perennial cellar dwellers. Teams make shit work. The saints had considerably less cap room tHan us, but figured out how to sign Jair us Byrd to a 60 mill contract while also making n jimmy graham the richest te in football. \nNo. Slapping a ridiculous 13 million dollar tag for 1 player and signing terrible players no one else wanted for pennies was not a good plan. Plus. All that being said, if we waited out these bad contracts and collected cap room, guess what? We have to sign star, cam, luke, short, benji, and maybe TD to huge contract extension and we are back at square one, trying to fill out the roster w bottom of the barrel guys. This cap clearing nonsense is rather futile, especially when you consider how bad it has made this team is, and how cash strapped teams are in the playoffs every year.", "It's funny how short people's memories are. The first5-6 weeks of the season he was essentially flawless.  He was the highest gradeD qb by pff on the season.\n His high passed were nonexistent.  He had 1 int. He was pinpoint accurate.    Now he has a few bad games, which has a TON to do with an inept offensive coordinator and the worst oline in the league. It's pretty clear that those things are starting to get to him. He's still only 25. I'd love to see Luck run this putrid offense. They have neither protected nor equipped him with adequate pieces for success. What a fuc king joke. You really wonder why the qb with the least time to throw per drop back (pff) is suddenly rushing throws and losing composyre? It's called she'll shocked. It's what the Giants did to Brady in the first super bowl. It's what we did to Matt Ryan a few times.it's what happened to David carts CAREER  after a promising start. \nSeriously.  People need to get their head out of their asses and open there fucking eyes. It seems no matter how great Cam gets, his status as a franchis qb is in question every tune he has a couple bad games--like every fucking qb in nfl history has. \n Also: you realize the chances of us getting a young franchise qb as good as Cam(or better) are slim to none right? We went our whole franchise history w out even a sniff of a franchise qb. It's why teams settle for flawed guys like Dalton and nick foles for their franchise qbs. Because thY can take decades, generations to find. One of Cams caliber?  Arguably once in a lifetime (at least per team). \n Also, he's FUCKING 25 YEARS OLD. you people need to lower your expectations of a guy who is still a kid. Still growing.  I guess it's his own fault for being the first young qb to develop super fast and take the league by storm, fuck Cam right?

I think it's fairly hypocritical to love him for all this antics all these years, then as soon he goes to another team think he's an ass. I will always support him--of course I want the panthers to win and to shut him down, but I'm not gonna get salty or dislike him now because he's talking trash, and staying the same player he was for us..", "Because what cam has done for this team doesn't boil down to one game.

I used to be offended when people called this the worst fan base I'm foot all but now I can see it. A shitty stadium atmosphere that gives us no  home field advantage,  and fickle fans that turn on Cam in an instant. The kid who has carried this team on his back since day 1. Because he can't carry them all himself he's a failure. Shit man he's still only 25. He has arguably the worst oline in the nfl and bottom 5 offensive weaponry to work with. This shit wax going to happen. I don't know what you expect. That was really the worst gsme of cam a career last night. Now our shitty fans are saying he's not the answer , quickly forgetting he was pretty much perfect the first 4-5 games of the season. I always thino to myself, what did I do to deserve this team? But maybe this fan base as a whole doesn't deserve shit. \nCam is an excellent young qb. One of the greatest young franchise qbs in nfl history. He's bein done a great injustice by an arrogant gm who possibly has an ulterior motive  and our shitty fans who are now now questioninig whether he's the answer. Sure, haters gonna hate.

Deangelo showed that he's sitll as good as ever in the last 3-4 games last season. That being said, he is 29(old for a rb) and he a ridiculous amount of money for a cash strapped team that has a 25 year old runningback who is just as talented(some argue even more so). \n Don't get your hopes up, I think there's a slim to none chance of the Panthers cutting him, at least this year. If he shows any sign of decline next season then he may be cut, but if he's still the same deangelo, I imagine we ship him away for whatever we can get.

You are basically teaching your brain to interpret sexual stimulus in a way that causes ratcheting intensity to muscle contraction, release and the sensation of orgasm. Sometimes, if a woman is struggling to get there, and mood stabilizing drugs or hormonal imbalance are not the cause, I often recommend meditation (you don't have to go all new age for this) to banish frustration, doubt, and worry, as well as muscle strengthening and increasing vaginal awareness. \n Meditation often gets a bad rap, but I must insist that I am recommending a very simple form of it. Merely, instituting breathing exercises and actively clearing your mind can help create a calm, safe place for exploration free of personal judgement or negativity. You are learning a new skill! You must compliment and reward yourself (unless it turns out shaming gets you off - but in either case, you must create that judgement free space to figure that out!). Being able to free your mind from pressures to orgasm may help you achieve this goal that you desire so strongly. If you focus too hard in what you can't do, you create a self fulfilling prophesy. Instead, focus on what you enjoy, fill your body with that feeling with every breath. Allow your mind to imagine that feeling flowing from your clit and vagina down to the tips of your fingers and toes. Revel in how your body feels. Focus only on that. \n Ok, now if you read that and think i am crazy, or exaggerating that pleasure, I would recommend some vaginal awareness and strength training.  I rarely push products, but I am gonna recommend looking into LELO balls. They are essentially momentum balls that you can wear in your vagina while you do your daily routine. Basically, they are little rubber balls inside a larger plastic casing, and as you move, they move with you. By jiggling around, they increase awareness of your vagina and encourage your muscles to lightly contract to the motion. The stimulation helps strengthen your vagina. Both awareness and strengthening are good things when trying to break through from pre to post orgasmic.", "In a way, however, this man's preference does answer your question.

This club formed because some, dumb, 14 year-old boy told one of them that a hairy pussy was disgusting (not to slam preferences, it is ok to have them. But this particular boy was not only inexperience, but also cruel for power). THEN, to make matters even worse, after they had all shaved together, they all gossiped about whose was prettiest/ugliest! One girl had a very large clittoris. They practically crucified her for it. None of these girls would be commenting on this forum as adults.

It is a pejorative term used to slut shame women with active sex drives. If you are asking a question about your sex drive because you are comparing it to what society seems normal for women and their corresponding \"appropriate\" levels of desire, you are gonna have a bad time. \n Second, even though nymphomania is a non-clinical term, there are sexual conditions where people engage in unhealthy sex as driven by compulsion. The central features of these disorders are that sexual activity is an insatiable need, often interfering with other areas of everyday functioning; sex is impersonal, with no emotional intimacy; and despite frequent orgasms, sexual activity is generally not satisfying. If these are symptoms of what you are experiencing, then it is possible that you may be hypersexual, have a sex addiction, or are sexually compulsive. \n Finally, engage in this thought experiment where you substitute the word woman for man in every normative description of an appropriate sex drive and sexual behaviors a man may engage in. or example, women can want to have sex every day. Women can start masturbating at very young ages. Women can masturbate often. Women enjoy masturbating. Women can fantasize about sex and sexual situations as soon as puberty kicks in. All of this is healthy. All of this is within the very broad spectrum of human sexual behaviors."]}, {"subreddit": "WTF", "posts": ["A less abrasive version of the above comment is to invoke the slippery slope argument.

They need not be. \n Second, inbreeding occurs FAR LESS FREQUENTLY in the wild, BECAUSE population sizes are usually large enough to prevent against it and, even when they are not, a population only needs one unrelated individual per generation to prevent an inbreeding depression (think of the wild cheetah population as illustrative). Inbreeding is a term most commonly associated with livestock breeders (rather than as a phenomenon in a wild population), which practice controlled breeding to eliminate undesirable characteristics within a population, which is also coupled with culling of what is considered unfit offspring, especially when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock. \n Generally, for this kind of thing to happen in the wild, a population would need to experience a severe bottleneck and total isolation from all other populations of that particular species in order to experience threats to genetic diversity and those other problems associated with inbreeding. A population dropping from 5000 individuals to 2500 individuals might eliminate some genetic diversity (hence why only 1 in 15,000 Bengal tigers are white), but this would not, per se, cause inbreeding issues. In fact, no issues of inbreeding were noted in tiger populations as small as a couple of hundred individuals (because the population was not completely isolated), and only began to crop up when a population of tigers that  had plummeted to 12  completely isolated individuals, and even then - those observing the tigers noted only a crash in diversity, not those problems often associated with inbred tigers (clubbed feet, arched backs, stripelessness, strabismus, etc.)."]}, {"subreddit": "pics", "posts": ["It is illegal to collect glass eels in many east coast states without a take permit, which often severely limits the harvest amount.

When the 10,600-acre (43 km2) depot was created in 1941, a 24-mile (39 km) fence was erected around its perimeter, isolating a small herd of White-tailed deer, some of whom had white coats. These deer are not albino, but instead carry a set of recessive genes for all-white coats. The fence creates a genetic bottleneck causing high levels of inbreeding. The constant inbreeding (mating of close relatives like parents and children, brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren, greatgrandparents and greatgrandchildren...etc.) has allowed the various genes to align in offspring to be expressed as white deer. With the artificial protection of the fence, the wildlife inside the depot flourished. The white deer are an example of artificial selection and are subject to inbreeding depression which can lead to reduced fecundity and malformations. The white deer population behind the fence at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center is subject to severe foot and leg deformities leading to crippling. \n In the 1950s, the depot commander forbade GI's from shooting any white deer.

Cause this language is the least intuitive to understand by copy/paste, if you don't have OOP experience. Are you familiar with class inheritance and interfaces? If not, it's too early to try to do something on that scale. Generics are a pretty messy thing on their own that often make even experienced Java programmers facepalm hard. First, look here if you recognize anything \n that'll explain the whole \"extends/implements\" business. \n Second, generics are holders for types - like variables are holders for values.  T ,  K ,  V  are called  type parameters . Say we're making out own LinkedList that will hold only Strings: \n class MyLinkedList {    \n    Node head;    \n    class Node {    \n        String value;    \n        Node next;    \n    } \n    //.....//        \n }\n \n Now, we can only use this structure if we plan to store Strings in it. But what if we want to reuse it for Integers, Floats or other types? We parametrize it: \n class MyLinkedList&lt;T&gt; {   \n    class Node&lt;T&gt; {    \n        T value;    \n        Node next;    \n    }     \n \n Now when we want to make a list of Integers, we instantiate the list like so: \n MyLinkedLIst&lt;Integer&gt; ml = new MyLinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;();    \n \n and if we want another one with Strings, \n MyLinkedList&lt;String&gt; ml2 = new MyLinkedList&lt;String&gt;();    \n \n In this example. T is a type parameter, and Integer and String are  type arguments  . Note that in this example, one list cannot mix different type arguments - either all of its entries consist of nodes with Integers in them, or nodes with Strings values. \n This is the very tip of the generic iceberg (and not even a glimpse  of shipwrecks it can cause :/) so here's a more detailed introduction \n Now, you're getting an error because", "Ah, I see. So you do want them as parameters. \n So as far as I understand you have a parent abstract class Publication that you're subclassing - do you have to make a Publication subclass for each type of Book? ComicBookPublication and such? or are you supposed to have one Publication class and have it handle different types of books? Or is it up to you to decide? \n See, if your base class is Book and it has all types of subclasses, you can just implement one method  removePublication(Book book)  inside Publication class and it will work with every instance of the Book subclass  right \"out of the box\". \n If you're supposed to have different subclasses for Publication, you can still maintain an ArrayList of the Book type and implement  remove  method once, in a parent class: \n public class Publication {    \n     protected ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; listOfBooks;     \n     public boolean removePublication(Book book) {     \n           listOfBooks.remove(book);     \n     }    \n}    \n \n ComicBookPublication will then inherit its own ArrayList of comic books, and BookPublication will have its own arraylist of some other books, and  remove  method will work on each respective list without you having to make it abstract and override it for every subclass - that's why we have a Book base class to begin with. When you create an abstract class, you want to make sure that some subclass' behavior will be  different  from that of another subclass - that's why you override the abstract method depending on the subclass. \n p.s. before I confuse the rest of bejeezus out of you, maybe link to an assignment or", "So in a nutshell, each program in Java runs in its own  process . Imagine a process as an isolated sandbox that has its own virtual memory (as in \"fake\" memory addresses mapped to real RAM by the operating system). Other processes cannot access your program's sandbox (unless you want them to communicate and implement a lot of complex things and export stuff back and forth, but that's a really advanced topic which is irrelevant for now - just imagine they can't, period). \n Now within each process you can have multiple threads (mini-processes) that  share  the same virtual memory (can read and modify each other's data easily if you let them) - like a bunch of kids playing in the same sandbox, who can share their toys and build shit together, etc. By default, each process runs one thread, but some frameworks, like Swing or Android make use of multithreading to improve performance and to make user interaction smooth and transparent. You can create new threads that work in parallel (the real performance gain will depend on your hardware though, as well as your OS being able to utilize multiple cores, if it can't or you only got one core your multithreading will be \"multi\" on paper pretty much, they will still have to wait their turn for the CPU to run). \n Multiple threads can share resources - objects, files, network connection - or they use their own. Imagine having to draw stuff on screen and at the same time do some network communication, to retrieve a bunch of images from the internet for example. The thread responsible for drawing has very little interaction with the one doing the networking and they can work at the same time, one in the foreground where it can be interacted with, and one in the background. But once the images are delivered, they have to be drawn on screen. So your program has to have a shared resource where the network thread is gonna store its stuff, and the UI thread is gonna retrieve it from. \n Java standard library provides a  Runnable  interface with the method  run() . This method contains a bunch of commands to be executed by a thread that invokes it. It can be another thread altogether, or it can sit in its own separate thread.  Thread  class is just an implementation of Runnable interface (again you will have to implement its  run()  method yourself to tell it what to do) which has additional methods to control its execution, such as  start()   or  interrupt() . You usually implement Runnable inside some other class when that class inherits from something other than Thread (since Java does not allow multiple inheritance). The class can behave like any other at any other time, but when you give it the  run()  method you can hand the instance of this class off to some Thread and tell it to run in parallel. \n Note that if you want your Runnable to execute in parallel, you can only do it from a Thread. You create a  new Thread()  and pass it the instance of your Runnable as constructor parameter, then call  thread.start() . Without doing that,  invoking the run() method on an instance itself will just make it execute like any other method.", "Casting is temporarily changing the static type of a variable. You cannot cast unrelated types to each other but you can cast a supertype to its subtype (and if the actual object, as in what the variable points to at runtime, is of that subtype, it will work - but otherwise you will get a ClassCastException). \n Casting makes people uncomfortable because it fells somewhat unnatural, to \"assume\" runtime behavior at compile-time. For example, \n Object o - new String(\"abc\");    \no = new Integer(1);   //perfectly legal since Integer is a subclass of Obejct    \nString s = (String) o; //compiler warning but ok, ClassCastException at runtime    \n \n Casting tells the compiler \"I know the declared type of that variable is X, but I  promise  that at this point, at runtime, it will be pointing to a value of type Y\". That's why the compiler warns about this sort of thing. it's a bit unsafe to hardcode your assumptions as to how the program will behave when you run it. Often you can't get around it though, especially in large framework with a lot of interfaces, callbacks, generic classes etc. \n There are also safe casts. For example, it's common to do when overriding  equals() : \n @Override\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {    \n    if (!(o instanceOf MyClass)) return false;   \n    MyClass mc = (MyClass) o;    \n    return this.something == mc.something   \n}    \n \n In this case we're only casting to MyClass when we know for sure that the dynamic (runtime) type of Object o is indeed MyClass, We can only get to this part of code if it's true. \n Another type of a perfectly safe typecast is \"upcast\" - is when you case a subclass to a superclass. Although it's absolutely redundant, since every instance of a subcalss is automatically an instance of a superclass. \n \"Parsing\" is taking a blob of data and trying to decipher what it supposed to represent (or \"force\" it to represent something). For example, you parse a JSON file to create Java objects from its elements. You try to parse a String to integer or float when you need to check whether the text data you received is a number or something else. You parse a text String representing a mathematical expression if you want to solve it."]}, {"subreddit": "learnprogramming", "posts": ["I was ELI5'd polymorphism real simple once. John is a guy.

Therefore, it's a useful habit to have to design your components  to an interface  (where interface is a \"contract\", not in a strict OOP meaning). \n 2) Define the Base, or the \"skeleton\" of your class - i.e., outline its general behavior, different states and create dummy methods to reflect said states and behavior.  Keep it as broad as possible  (if you looked into standard libraries and popular APIs you could've noticed the following pattern: \n ListInterface list = new SpecificListClass();    \n \n where SpecificListClass is a concrete implementation of ListInterface. Whereas ListInterface merely defines  what  its implementing classes should be doing, SpecificListClass defines  how  objects of its type will do it. Both LinkedList and ArrayList implement the same  size() ,  add() ,  remove()  etc, funcitonality, but they do it differently, however these implementation details are  abstracted away  (transparent to the caller/user) so you really don't have to think about  how  to add an item to the list of your choosing - you just know the item will be added when you call  myList.add() . \n 3)  Is a  vs  has a  test is useful when you're determining whether to use inheritance vs. composition. Sometimes its simple (House vs. Room - does a House have  a Room, or is a Room a subtype of House? while sometimes you can argue both, default to the easiest, most intuitive choice - in most cases, houses  have  rooms, therefore, Room should be a class of its own, and your House class should contain one or more instances of Room as its member variables). Sometimes it's trickier. \n For example, you're designing a Card object. Right now you're  coding Poker game but what if later on you're asked to make something like Solitaire? What if you want to simulate a card trick, or some fortune telling spread or whatever. They all have different rules, but are those rules really relate to Cards, vs the game itself? Card is a generic interface (it doesn't have to be a literal  Interface , might as well be an abstract class - we'll see the difference later) - ie. whatever you're playing, enumerate all the traits and behaviors common to  all  cards (they all have such properties as rank and suit). Does it need any additional states, can it, or should it do anything else outside of the game? probably not. \n Just look at a simple deck of real-life cards. There they are, they can't change their position in a deck unless somebody shuffles them, they cannot change their suit and rank, once printed, they are  final  and will never change. Anything else is the property of the game you're playing. So there you have it - your base Card class with suit and rank properties will most likely be enough. \n Now you can see how you can compose the Deck object by simply creating an array of Cards and shuffling them or doing whatever it is the spread requires. You do not change the state of individual Cards, you change the state of a Deck by rearranging the cards in it. So our Deck class is going to be an upper level class by itself. (and later when you're working on a different game that makes use of partial decks, or more than one deck, you can just extend the Deck class and remove/add more cards and functions specific to that particular game). \n 5) Once you've defined who does what and who belongs where, analyze the interaction between classes and program flow. Your objects might have state (it can be constant, like the state of a single Card, or it can be changed by some action, like the sequence of Cards in a Deck, a Hand given to a Player, or a Score that a Player has). While objects'  states  belong to the objects (Player class migjt have fields like  myScore  and  myHand ), these states often have to be set and/or modified from the \"outside\". It's up to you as a designer to decide what states can be modified from within their class, and what states depend on your class' interaction with other classes. \n Let's look at the Game itself. That's where all the heavy lifting happens. That's where you keep your score, that's what contains your simple, or specialized Deck of cards, that's where you keep track of the players. All these - decks, rules, players - are properties and behaviors of the Game class. \n Consider the Player class. Let's say a Player keeps a score during a game - but how it's calculated depends on the game they're playing. A Player cannot change their own score - only the Game can change the score that belongs to a particular Player. Therefore, a Player  has  a score as part of their state,  and it can be accessed with  player.getScore()  , but  the logic of calculating the value of the score  that will be passed  to  player.setScore()  should be defined  inside the Game class . I hope you understand why - to keep your Player as generic as possible. So you can have him play all kinds of different games, ones with or without scores, without having to change anything inside the Player class.", "Oh - I don't get why this didn't happen with the integer variables tempo and meter? I didn't use a return value with those either but they still worked \n Have a closer look at our Cello class and its instance variables (or members, or fields, whatever you call them). You have  tempo  and  meter  declared as instance variables, therefore, they will be visible to every method inside Cello class. When you modify  tempo  variable in  setTempo()  method,  getTempo()  is going to see it and use its modified value. \n Now look at  setPickup() . Do you see the mistake? \n String arrayPickUp [] = {\"bridge\", \"neck\", \"both\"};\nString pickUpString;\n***String pickUp = null;*** // there you go    \n \n You define  pickUp  as a  local variable  inside the method. You already have a class member named  pickUp  that you declared at the beginning of Cello class, and that member is initialized to  null  as its supposed to. But the class member  pickUp  and the variable you create in  setPickup()  method are  completely different things , as if they had different names. Therefore, your method sets value to the  local   pickUp  variable (because local variables get precedence inside methods), and your instance variable - the one you're assuming you'll be using in  getPIckUp()  never gets initialized. Methods cannot see local variables defined in other methods, they can only see instance variables (class members), and your class member  pickUp  is never modified, it just stays  null ."]}, {"subreddit": "relationships", "posts": ["Let's play this out.

Or what if his teeth would have been all messed up or missing. would OP still consider him attractive? wouldn't she be just as devastated? \n I don't think he took advantage of her by having sex. Maybe he was trying to give it a chance. Maybe he was thinking women were like men, and the rejection will sting less if he \"puts out\" first (I mean we're talking mature people here and maybe he's had a chance with women in their 30s who were in it just for the sex before). Either way, he was not repulsed or revolted and he was not dry-heaving inside looking at OP when she was naked as she dramatically convinced herself. He was just  disappointed  the realit didn't match his expectations.

OP is fixated on that dude being \"repulsed\" by her which sort of overdramatize the whole thing and make the guy out to be the asshole.

Yeah, that's... that's not going to work, not long term anyway. \n >Instead of trying super hard to make sure she doesn't lose me \n Really? Why should anyone try \"super hard\" to not lose someone if it takes so much work to keep them in the first place? You want a partner you can feel safe with, not a challenge. Besides, maybe, just maybe the fear of you dumping her isn't something she's losing sleep over. There are people who would choose inner peace and quiet and personal space over the fuss of a turbulent relationship. Girls can be self-sufficient too. \n And all these dramatic gestures, dates, flowers, etc - do you really do this  for her , cause these things make her happy, or is it a \"dating protocol\" you feel you need to follow in order to get what you want in return? Cause it doesn't work like that. Instead of going all out and spending money on generic \"romantic\" gifts, maybe you should take your time and really get to know her. Does she really want those things? Is she a romantic person at all? Does she like to go out on dates, or she's happier at home on the couch watching TV?  Flashy gestures are impressive when you watch from the sidelines and they're great for an occasional ego boost but it really doesn't mean anything if there's no thought behind them other than wanting to impress and/or to check items off the list. \n People make this mistake. They get into relationships like they're buying an expensive car or signing up for a fancy service. They don't learn about each other, they just  expect  things. She's not an investment, she's your partner. Instead of attempting to \"get your money's worth\" try to just... be with her?.. share experiences, learn new things, just hang out.

Just go to a shrink and they'll make you just the way I want\" and then waits for an immediate remorse and approval, and when the SO feels hurt and brings up her points for maybe not wanting to change, or it turns out they have a different views on parenting, OP is  appalled  and \"she's spewing bullshit\". Apparently, \"bullshit\" equals \"not agreeing with me on everything 100% the second I finished insulting you\". \n She didn't cheat on him. She didn't insult him, or acted inconsiderate, or did any of the thing that would make him feel abandoned, small, humiliated.

Out of nowhere. And re-read the second part of the post, how bitter and angry he is at her, he goes out of his way to paint her a villain and he even stoops to insulting her in front of his friends and let them talk shit about her. That girl who he apparently cared very much about and who did nothing but loved him and tried to make him happy. \n I mean he had almost a week to mull this over and  for him  it was important and grand and full of nuance. But for her the entire thing got condensed into \"oh by the way, you eat mac and cheese and I resent you for it\", out of nowhere.

No, they don't report/arrest/otherwise punish your ass for admitting use if you don't have anything illegal on you (duh), are not underage, don't have any outsanding warrants, and generally act like a normal patient (like don't be violent or super-rude or try and steal shit or whatever). Don't lie to the doctors, they've seen it all before, they just need the information on how to treat you, the more cooperative you are the better attitude they'll have. It'll probably be a General Hospital kind of setting cause they have to take in the uninsured, they've literally seen it all, your silly staph bumps are a case of acne compared to the shit they have to deal with on a daily basis.  These folks just want you better and out the door asap. \n Also, if you do not have insurance, ask for a social worker and most of the time they'll work something out, there are tons of options available, people just don't know how to ask. If you do not own any serious property like stock or real estate and are currently unemployed, you might qualify for charity care. So ask a social worker, that's what they do. They'll also  offer you treatment options, like counseling, free detox facilities if available and a list of suboxone doctors in your area. \n Now abscesses. Abscesses are gross and the get awfully painful, but most drain on their own in a few days. After they drain they heal really fast if you're not being an idiot and keep dirt and needles away from the spot. Warm compresses help draw the nastiness to the surface more quickly, and OTC antibiotic ointments or even rubbing alcohol, get the job done - as far as the ouchie is concerned that is. \n The  real  reason any IV user should seek medical help for \"just an abscess\" , though, is that they make it crazy easy for the infection to enter  your bloodstream and then to your heart and brain. It can turn from a painful red bump into an amazing clusterfuck of life threatening conditions in a matter of days (guess how I know this). So no, popping a bunch of strep throat pills you got left over from last year won't help. You'll most likely need IV antibiotics, at least initially, until the docs figure out what you have (it's probably staph, it's always staph, but it can just as easily be MRSA or some flesh eating thing so why take chances). \n If you decide to wait it out (sigh) things to be on a lookout for are fevers, chills, excessive sweating, weird muscle pains and headaches and difficulty breathing. If your mid-lower back starts hurting every time you laugh or cough and you can't breathe comfortably if you lie flat on your back or side, congratulations, you have pneumonia. If you suddenly get a deep cramp-like pain in your arm or leg that won't go away and doesn't become stronger or weaker when you move, you'd really want to check it out because it might be a blood clot. \n If one day you wake up  in a shitton of pain in one of your extremeties and in addition they turn bluish and/or pale and cold, it's definitely a blood clot and it has a very good chance to evolve into gangrene (although arterial clots like these are pretty rare but totally can happen with blood infections). \n Even If you only have a \"live\" abscess and suddenly start getting cotton fevers every other time you shoot, it's probably not cotton fever anymore, it's bacteremia (infection in the bloodstream). Which means the germs are floating freely through your heart and lungs, planting neat little colonies of hungry offspring here and there and you should  get your ass to the ER asap  godfuckingdamnit. \n But most importantly,  do not afraid to go get medical help . If you're a minor or already are in legal trouble you know about it. Otherwise, your drug use is just another part of the diagnosis for your doctor.

It happens gradually, in slow little increments, the changes in your reasoning are almost unnoticeable from the outside (skipping gym one week cause getting high feels better than working out, deciding not to clean the house the next because getting high is more fun than having company anyway, flaking out on plans you made with friends because they're boring and getting high is not, putting off something you usually do on time because it's not like they'll cut you off if you wait till the final notice to pay that bill) - in short, there's no single dramatic change, those are all insignificant, harmless things that slowly build up to apathy.

From there it's pumped into the lungs, gets back into the heart enriched with oxygen, and then pumped into the arteries to bring the oxygen to the tissues. \n Say you get some dirty dope into your veins. The bacteria travels through the blood (it's called bacteremia) and as far as I understand the immune system is trying to fight it, which causes little blood clots to form. To get inside the heart, the blood is pushed through a bunch of heart valves (two let the blood in, two others let it out). Heart valves are made of tissue that is a little like plastic - smooth and they have no blood vessels on them, which means the immune cells have trouble reaching there. Tiny blood clots stick to the valve, along with the remaining unkilled bacteria, which creates perfect conditions for the little fuckers to feed an procreate. Since the blood is still pumping through the infected valve, a bunch of bacteria gets washed inside the heart and sets up shop on the heart lining, making more nasty colonies, forming more clots. \n These infected clots then get pushed from inside the heart into the lungs, which make the germies right at home - all spongy and airy, it's a freakin vacation spot.  That's how you get pneumonia. From there it's just a self-feeding cycle - more bacteria is delivered from the lungs to the tissues, and so it goes, until you haul your dying ass to the ER and they stick a garden hose inside you and slam you with tons of latest-generation antibiotics. Luckily, you got there in time and the heart damage was not too great, and you still have some parts of your lungs that are salvageable, and the blood clots that traveled through the arteries to other internal organs haven't clogged anything important that caused those organs to start dying. \n If antibiotics work, you are still left with some heart valve damage. If the valve that was infected is not \"too important\" they let you go as is, you'll have some mild heart problems but nothing too serious. Otherwise, you might need a valve replacement surgery (which you may or may not qualify for, depending on your state, insurance and drug use situation - sometimes, if it's not too critical, the surgeons just won't touch people who use IV until they get clean, because artificial valves are extremely susceptible to bacteria, so they'd rather  have you live with a bum ticker than die a few weeks after the surgery).

Kill it, sell it, whatever, just get rid of it. \" \nSo again, the guy does what he's told and in a few days he's back at the Rabbi's house, gleaming and overjoyed. \n\"It's a miracle! - he exclaims, - \"It's so spacious and quiet in my house now!\"", "Confirmation bias. You might be only noticing the women who display the familiar flaws. Others are invisible. A lot of girls are raised with a \"princess mentality\", and ironically, those are the girls that get noticed and get hit on most often - perpetuating the stereotype. To be fair, most dudes your age are not exactly the embodiment of decency and rational thinking either, but somehow you let it slide huh? You approach each guy as a person but you lump the very limted representative population of girls you do notice in the same category. Others might just escape your radar. \n About the girls in your class. Imagine you're black, ok, not black (sorry) you're an awkward goofy-looking immigrant from some obscure Eastern European country with a funny accent. Some people are unlikely to take seriously no matter how capable you can be. You approach a study group and they reject you. You approach another and they reluctantly agree, smirking and rolling their eyes and joking behind your back. Now, you're not smarter or dumber than anyone else in this group - there are subjects you're good at, there are subjects you struggle with, but every time you ask a question you're either patronized (\"ok nevermind here I did it for you\") or are subtly made fun of. Think about it. Is there a dude in your class that tends to ask \"stupid\" questions? How does the rest of the class react? Mild annoyance I'm guessing, and the next moment everyone's moved on. But what happens when a girl asks the same stupid question? Do you think they don't notice? Do you think  you  wouldn't notice the subtle, but consistent \"reminders\" that you're somehow less competent than the others, simply because you dress or talk differently? Now throw in the  stigma of \" girls can't math \n You're actively looking to discredit people who just like you, need help, just like you, feel lost and overwhelmed by the amount of material - but whereas you feel like you're being judged solely on your merit, they feel they're being judged on anything but. Think how you reacted every time a girl approached your study group - would  you  want to be in her place? Honestly, would you think you'd be able to get as far as you have if you were female and got the same treatment from your classmates as the girls in your group? \n Now I'm not saying each and every one of them are necessarily as good as anyone else, but cannot get a break because they are being discouraged or excluded or whatever, -  again, just like the guys, there are smarter ones, and there are dumber ones, I'm sure you'll find a couple of dudes you or other folks had to carry at least in the beginning, through a semester or two. But with those guys, improvement was expected, and they had things explained to them under the assumption that they'll eventually get it. Did any of the girls get the same chance? Or was it simply \"oh god I'm stuck with  a broad better do the whole thing myself before she fucks it up\" every time?", "Oh, this again. \nWhere do I even begin. \n The biggest mistake people like you make is assuming they're some kind of a gift from god just because they're not evil or have any vices. That's not how it works. What makes you think anyone would benefit from having you as a partner? what do you have to offer? not being an asshole? not drinking, not hitting them? anything else? why should she pick you over that guy accross the street who runs with his dogs every day, or her coworker who goes to pilot school, or even her neighbor who is always there to hear her vent about her day. Do you  notice  people you have \"crushes\" on, at all - or do you fixate on how happy they would make  you  if only they'd give you a chance? \n You're too deep into your head, obsessing over your own complexities and idiosynchrasies like you're the only man in the universe to have them. We all have them, we just keep our eyes open to what's outside. Being \"introverted\" doesn't make you unavailable, or special, or \"deeper\" or whatevertheshit, seriously it just a way your brain prefers to process things. For the people out there, you're only as good as what you can give.  You are not going to make anyone happy by just being your deep and amazing self - you're probably gonna make them miserable, tbh - if you keep isolating yourself from experiences and coddle your \"awkwardness\". People cannot magically get inside your brain and see all the beauty and complexity of your inner world. They have their own, and they're too busy for that shit. It's what you show them, the experiences you gift them, the value of time they spend with you - you have to offer something real. If you just want to get it over with the physical stuff cause you feel your virginity is a \"defect\", just hire an escort. But it will have the same impact as learning to drive. \n If you want a woman to take you home, you don't need her to embrace your entire inner universe, just don't be repulsive or creepy or extremely boring. The rest is in being open to hearing her and allowing yourself to be heard. Start chatting people up, not just women, random people about random shit, - mailmen, old ladies, people waiting in a cash register line, - see how easy it is to connect with a complete stranger on a more intimate level pretty much instantly  when you listen. People love attention, we all feel lonely deep down, we all want to be noticed in a positive way. You want others to see and appreciate your inner world - they want the same. Build yourself up knowing this - every person whom you've made smalltalk to and made feel  noticed , is going to notice you too, and remember you, at least till the end of the day - some till the end of their lives. \n Don't fixate on an impression  you're  making on them, most of them will barely notice the color of your hair or the depth of your voice - it's what you were willing to let them show you that matters. \n Now, a woman, especially in a certain setting, like a bar or a first date, is going to judge you based on your appearance and level of confidence - of course, just like she judges every other guy that tries to talk to her - but that's only the preliminary part of the mating dance. If you pass the non-creepy, non-gross stage it's all down to her remembering you. Make sure she doesn't remember you as another dude who tried to show himself off, or a dude who was asking all the right generic questions about her \"dreams and aspirations\", or another dude who was too afraid to breathe any other word than \"sure\" to not scare her away. Don't be a dude who wants to get something from her - be a dude who wanted to know stuff about her. Be genuine. People are just as desperate as you to have anyone try to see and understand who they really are. If she remembers you as a guy she let  inside her head, even for a few minutes, she might just consider letting you see the inside of her bedroom.", "Everybody's telling you to talk to her but let's say you did. Now what. \n So assuming you've told her, I'm gonna be optimistic and even assume she reacted in a mature manner and promised to be more receptive to your advances... it might not change the fact that you are both stuck in a rut and you've just piled some more junk onto her plate. Just another responsibility, she'll have to work in \"do husband\" somewhere between folding laundry and a grocery run. How long do you think it will last?.. \n So assuming it is a rut situation and there's nothing more... ominous lurking underneath, let's asses the damage. \n Is she a stay at home mom? How often does she have time or opportunity to dress up, go out, have company, in short, do fun single people stuff, when was the last time she could forget about being a mommy and remember that's she's a woman, she's still desirable (yes she knows you want to have sex with her but at this point it might just seem like another annoying house chore to her, and the one with the lowest priority). Since she had your kid, some of your needs have become less important to her - that's only natural, - but that doesn't mean you have. \n What would  you  want if you were her? What do you think could re-ignite that spark and make her look at you in a differnet way? Maybe try to break character, change the dynamic. No implications or expectations at first, just start courting her again, something small and silly and  almost effortless, like leaving a funny note or bringing her some guilty pleasure food she loves, maybe a flower, a toy, without an occasion, just because. Throw in some inside jokes, light-weight gossip about people at work, an occasional compliment - not some generic \"you look beautiful today honey\" but some small thing you genuienly like about her and she might not even know you notice,  - stuff like that. In short, stop absent-mindedly going through the motions whlie wallowing in your misery start  paying attention to the actual person that is your wife . \n See, with women sex isn't always 100% about arousal, a huge part of it is intimacy, both physical and emotional. Like a \"grandma hug\" or a back scratch, something comforting, with no sexual undertones. It's not about \"romance\" or some grand gesture, it's about the two of you and your very personal, unique relationship. Don't splurge on fancy romantic dinners or expensive gifts or similar cheesy generic shit. Avoid guilt-trips, there no worse turn off than a guilt trip. \n Also, if you want to make sex happen, you'll need to accomodate - the time, the place, make sure the kid's asleep or whatever - in short, again, don't put everything on her to-do list, she has enough balls in the air. She might not enjoy the physical aspect of intercourse very much due to her hormonal changes or plain tiredness,  but she might love the closeness and intimacy and the feeling of you two holding each other when it's all dark and peaceful and  nobody's talking about errands or bills or doctor visits. The point is - she gets a break from her role too. If you want to be spontaneous about it, be there to pick up things that may fall out of place.", "I'm sorry :[ \n You know, that's the biggest mistake girls make, thinking they're clever by dating dudes way below their standards.

And we didn't have internet back then. I copied what I could from my friends or the library but it was a small town in the middle of nowhere so libraries never had textbooks available and the waiting list was like a year long.... I took 3 US-equivalent of AP classes in computer science and same \"AP\"-level math and I did't even know what a freaking textbook looked like. Our teacher didn't show up to half the classes, he was a principal he didn't give a fuck.  I worked part time but I couldn't afford textbooks and only partly other stuff I needed for school - mother threw a fit every time I asked for anything school related, no matter how small. I had to make my own uniform t-shirt... like, dye an old white one and paste a school logo on it (luckily they sold the logos separately). We were immigrants and mother didn't speak the language and of course I was just making fun of her and shaming her illiteracy and lying to steal her money, whenever I tried to show her \"proof\" in form of my school documents. Fucking insane. \n Also - and I see it's pretty common here - seeing me study made her furious for some reason. She'd invent pointless time-consuming chores for me just the day before an exam... and then eagerly anticipate my reaction. Of course I was super careful and made sure to never as much as  look  like I was upset or pressured - I had to consciousy control my face muscles so I don't look \"grumpy\" or whatever. But she'd up the ante, she'd  act all concerned \"don't you have to study?\" \n I knew better than to answer \"yes\" - so in addition to wasting a day I desperately needed to fucking cram, on washing non-dirty windows and endless shopping trips I now had to convince her from the bottom of my heart that her requests weren't inconveniencing me at all. And she'd get stubborn and go \"yeah I know you say that, but you're probably  thinking   about it and how much you hate me. Of course how dare I ask for something when you have so much important things going on.. <insert major guilt trip  ending with how we all can't wait till she's dead> and I'm there just apologizing for stuff I didn't say, didn't do, didn't think - while she's making up ridiculous stupid shit on the fly and aggravating herself even further. \n And I'm trying not to think how I'm going to fail tomorrow and never ever get into the one specialty I've ever been interested in (because all highschool kids think like that :] You either get accepted today or your life is over!) And how it all will be my fault and what I should do to make it up to her because naturally she's expecting me to succeed. Of course it's all my fault, if I were smarter and paid more attention I wouldn't have to cram today - if I weren't so socially retarded I'd have a study group. If I weren't so lazy and inept I'd find another part time job to be able to afford a tutor. I waste so much time just daydreaming and I'm too disorganized... and it's only fair if I fail because I deserve it.. blah blah you know how it is. \n Of course it was never even suggested that my parents have SOME interest in helping me attend college. \"We're immigrants, we don't have money, after you're 18 you are on your own - don't forget we have you sister to take care of\". However! She wouldn't shut up how they had \"sacrificed everything\" to leave their home country for the sake of giving us \"better education\". Yep, the same education I was now struggling to acquire  despite  their efforts. She didn't just say \"gtfo and pay your own way\", oh no that would be too easy. I HAD to have a college degree, She didn't care in what, she didn't care  how  I was gonna pull it off, I just owed it to her to get it. She demanded I do it ASAP, because some of her friends' kids were already in the process of getting one (some of them ere like five years older than me but whatever). Like always, - she saw another kid eating a piece of candy and she'll keep throwing fits and making your life hell until she gets one just like it).", "Fuck. This. I handle yelling/violence ok, since mother rarely lost her temper, she just kept talking in that awful tone of hers, she'd throw shit occationally but at that point her getting loud and violent was a relief cause it made her lose her... focus?, not sure how to put it). I get physically ill when I'm around someone I know and they're tense or angry, even if it has nothing to do with me, even if they're not even looking in my direction. \n I can only relax when I'm alone in the house or everyone else is at their place, watching TV or sleeping or sitting at the computer - when they move about, especially in the kitchen, looking for something or moving stuff I get super jumpy like I'm supposed to be doing something and they'll get mad at me when they see I just sit there. I  always , fucking always get up and ask if they need anything and how I can help just so I can prevent them getting mad at me for \"not helping\". \n Of course the need to be \"convenient\" for everyone and their uncle which is like, duh, and the consequent \"rock and the hard place\" situations I artificially create for myself. Example - long line at the store, cart full of groceries, automatic checkout charges full price instead of sale price. There are 10 people waiting behind me, so of course I panic and bolt outta there. Enter a secondary panic attack on the way home while thinking up elaborate explanations/apologies for spending extra $2.30 when I didn't need to. And then of course I get resentful toward everybody because I seriously feel like my life is one continuous panicked apology, mostly for things I can't control, and nobody gives a shit they just have their requirements and they don't hesitate to give you a piece of mind whenever they don't like something.", "One of the many things I had realized when it was too little too late - you cannot trust their \"guidance\" (i.e. demands and expectations). It will ruin your life. Because in reality the N-types have the reasoning abilities of a five-year olds. They mimic whatever behavior they feel suits their need with friends and coworkers, just like little children mimic adults, but there's nothing real underneath the act. Their true colors are only visible to their family and children. Especially children, they don't see their kids as people with real needs and feelings - just a mindless, faceless extension of themselves that must take whatever shape they desire on a whim. \n Unfortunately, when you're a kid, you take their words at face value. You implicitly trust them to have your best interest and only do what's good for you, because isn't that what parents do? and by god they never shut up about it either. They're the most amazing parents ever. They've sacrificed so much. They only want what's best for you. You grow up believing this bullshit and you never get a chance to develop a personality, because you're always so busy accommodating their ever changing expectations. You stay blind long enough, they will destroy everything you ever held dear in life and then guilt you into making it up to  them . That's how drug addictions and suicides happen. \n Do not keep yourself accountable for everything he dumps on you. Set your own moral guidelines - you want to be able to support him to some extent when he's old, but for that to happen you owe it to yourself to become financially  and mentally  stable and to learn how to make your own informed decisions. It's the hardest thing ever - to overcome this knee-jerk \"ok ok I'll do whatever to avoid \"trouble\" because \"trouble\" will never end. They lack something in their brains, to see the real cause and effect connections in life, they only understand manipulation and revenge, - again, that 5 year old mentality. \n Your kid throws a tantrum in a toy store - you think he cares that you're behind on car payments or that his dental care has cost you half your savings? Same with N-parents. They don't understand other people's needs, and if they do - their understanding does not extend beyond their own perspective. Do not let a selfish five-year old run your life. Do what you think you have to do, just make sure to keep things you care about safely out of his reach.", "For starters, remember [JADE]( \n learn to recognize when they're trying to pull you into a no-win situation and hold your ground - but do not engage with them, just remind yourself in your mind that what you're doing isn't selfish, cruel or manipulative. Remember that their accusations are nothing but the reflection of their own toxic traits, - they're unable to think outside of their own experience. Example - if their go-to reaction when you try to confide in them and share your problems is to belittle, mock or dismiss your concerns - they're gonna assume everybody is doing the same thing to them, and try and accuse you of it. And of course you'll go out of your way to reassure that is not the case, to justify your words/behavior and to convince them \"it was not what you meant\" - and that's exactly how they get you. Avoid these situations at all costs. Let them think what they think, and do what  you  think is right for you. Remember that you can only rely on yourself and they're not gonna be there to bail you out, offer help and support and be there for you in general when you need it the most - it's up to you to build your own support network and this doesn't make you selfish, ungrateful and/or guilty. \n You're not the person they say you are. Their perception of you - and everyone else for that matter - is extremely skewed at all times, and you're not going to win by trying to play by their rules because the rules are going to keep changing, - but you also cannot make them see the error of their ways. They're incapable of objective thinking, just leave it at that and focus on yourself. Have a long-term escape plan and use it as a self-therapy tool - whenever you feel overwhelmed just start working out its finer details, it will give you confidence and something to look forward to. \n Also, talk to other people who understand. Don't try to justify yourself or make light of whatever's bothering you to people who don't. Whenever you're feeling guilty, try to pinpoint the exact source of that feeling and try to find a reason - does it even exist? or do you just feel \"guilty\" because that's how you're supposed to feel? Are you really accountable for not being able to read people's minds or know in advance how things will turn out? that sort of thing. Cultivate yourself from within, don't rely on others to define you - don't let their demands or expectations to change your view of yourself, instead, try to be as rational and objective as possible. You have flaws but so does  everyone else - focus on fixing those flaws for your own benefit, not on feeling guilty or making others forgive you.

(and if it's an inflated layout, you'll need a handle to it for  findViewById()  to work - like we use convertView  in list adapters) \n Your  main.xml  is set as the Activity's main layout, but it doesn't include  drawer_layout , it's in another file. So when  findViewAById()  goes searching for it within  main  it comes back empty-handed.", "The answers here have it but let me explain what they mean. \n Activity object is instantiated(created) as a simple Java object, except unlike normal Java programs, Android does not allow you to do it manually. It creates an Activity for you and then runs it through its start-up  lifecycle  stages - 1) activity is  created (instantiated) and its data initialized 2) activity is  started  (becomes visible to user) and 3) activity is  resumed  - ie. comes to focus and can be interacted with (fields and buttons become clickable etc.). \n Activity itself doesn't have child views. You have to give it a  layout , and that layout can have your edittext, your buttons and possibly other layouts as children. Thus,\n findViewById()  is a method that belongs to a View class (and its subclasses like ViewGroup and Relative/Linear/Etc.Layout). But for convenience, Activity class also  has a  findViewById()  method defined, except it doesn't do anything, it just delegates (transfers execution) to the same method that's defined in a ViewGroup or Layout, the one that you choose to set as your Activity's UI. \n That's what  setContentView()  method does - it selects an xml file  from /layout folder by name and attaches it to the Activity as its root Layout. The xml  is \"inflated\" (i.e. its View definitions translated from XML to Android objects by the framework) but right now these objects only have IDs, to access them from your Activity class you first need to assign each one to an appropriate variable. So this line of code \n EditText etxt = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText1);    \n \n says: 1) find the EditText object with id  editText1  inside this Activity's root layout 2) assign it to a variable named  etxt  of type EditText so you can access it later. \n This can only be done when you already have a Layout attached to your Activity. \n In your code however, you call  findViewById()  immediately after the Activity  is instantiated - even before  onCreate() , i.e. before the framework tells you \"your Activity is initialized and ready to use\", and most importantly -  before its root layout is inflated and set . So  findViewById()  goes looking for some view with some ID, it finds some internal variable like Activity.myRootLayout and tries to execute  myRootLayout.findViewById() , but this variable hasn't been set yet,  and consequently, you get a NullPointerException."]}, {"subreddit": "fatlogic", "posts": ["it is possible to be naturally underweight and healthy, especially if you're young.

Here's what's happened in the 23 years I've played so far. I began as the lowly Chief Bolko of the Golensizi, ruler of the counties of Opava and Cieszyn under the great King Rostislav of Great Moravia. I meant to use a character with only a single county, but I didn't realize he had two. Whatever; Opava apparently has no holdings aside from the top-level castle, so it wasn't really an advantage.) \n In 867, I, Chief Bolko, decided that it was time to expand my small dynasty. I began by marrying a genius priestess and finding spouses for my two brothers and my sister, and soon began putting my craptastic council to work, hoping to fabricate a claim on Krakow. Unfortunately, a couple of uneventful years passed, and the independence faction fired -  and the fool king let the traitors go.  Catholics, I tell you...any halfwit of the Slavic faith could have prevented the realm from shattering Moravia was no longer so great as its title claimed. Fortunately for me, this meant I no longer needed claims on Krakow and Opole to the north - I simply declared wars of conquest on my secessionist neighbors and slowly sieged my way to victory in the plains - first Krakow, then Opole. \n However, as I grew stronger, my liege grew weaker. I did not yet have the proper land to become a duke (half of a four-county duchy and a third of two three-county duchies), and yet my own levies already outnumbered the king's armies. Meanwhile, the Ksi\u0119stwo (duchy) of Wielkopolska to the north had soaked up the Ksi\u0119stwos of Kujawy and Mozawske from the east as well as the Ksi\u0119stwo of Slask, which had seceded from Great Moravia along with the rest. In the mid 870s, High Chief Piast Piast gathered his strength - surprisingly just under 1500 men - and attacked Moravia over a northwestern county. Though King Rostislav's men weakened the enemy's numbers, they all fell to the sword of the Piast army. In 877, as I watched my liege fall to his knees, I knew it was time to take matters into my own, more competent hands. \n Though I may be slow to speak yet still quick to anger, my ambition and my bravery know no bounds. I, mere count of a small quad-county area, declared a war for the subjugation of Polska, the de jure territory of which covered all twelve of Piast's counties. With his army weakened, and mine at full strength and backed by the might of the Pecheneg mercenaries (who were in turn backed by my surprisingly stout bank account), I beat back the fools who soon took a peace with my liege, and more importantly, slowly came to the realization that their days were numbered. \n In some sort of rash attempt to restore morale, Wielkopolska somehow created the Kingdom of Polska (seriously, how? I thought you couldn't create a title that was the justification for a war), rather than hire a band of mercenaries that would have chance of humbling my bold motives. But it was not to be. In just over a year, I, Bolko, conquered the weak and took the crown for myself, breaking free of the fledgling fool King Rostislav in the process. All it cost was a few hundred pieces and my left hand. \n Unfortunately, it was not to last. After less than a year, the fool Piast, now my vassal, declared another bloody war to put himself back on the throne, and halfway through my maiming got to me. I was dead after less than two years of kr\u00f3lship, and I passed over the great waters to the afterlife, able only to watch my son as he took helm of a nation even younger than his four years. \n After the boy kr\u00f3l won the war and imprisoned the bastard weakling, I watched from afar as young Kr\u00f3l Jacek mulled his options. Finally, he settled for banishing the traitor (who, by the way, held nearly every county and duchy in Polska). For some reason, most of the fools in the realm took offense from this, even after he dispersed the land fairly, keeping but a duchy and four counties for himself. He wisely granted land to a loving uncle and respecting cousin, as well as an advisor who is as loyal to my son as he was to me. As my overwhelmed son's reign went on, he managed to conquer a single county, and was soon halted by the return of Piast Piast and another (considerably smaller) revolt and a simultaneous Moravian holy war (his many Slavic neighbors were glad to join in and assist him, luckily), and eventually, after the Moravian buffer was all but destroyed, two Magyarorsz\u00e1g conquests to which he was forced to surrender immediately or risk preying neighbors. Soon, the regency ends, and I pray that young Jacek's early \"tyranny\" will soon be forgotten, that his authority will increase, and that one day, the sons of my son and their sons will fight back against the \u00c1rp\u00e1d horde. \n ^(wow, that was long."]}]}

Same setup with reason, a stack of pre-programmed combinator patches saved into one project file, but now I've also added an APC-40 to the mix to trigger the ableton loops. (I break the drums for each song into verse/chorus/bridge loops and have 3 variations of each set to no quantization legato trigger for freestyle flexibility--the main top level loop is set to retrig trigger for reset. ) Inside of live there is a main master FX rack that has been set up on each drum track with a bunch of fun glitch, filter, delay, and send fx for live jamming. \n With recent practices I'm working on using the looper fx within live to record the reason synths live and then set up loops and manipulate with fx in real time. still need some practice though. \n Hmm, that's a wall of text but basically,", "not true. I have a similar story to you (hardware-->reason-->omg ableton!). \n Rewired Reason is the only way to go. The coolest thing about ableton with reason is that, unlike most host/slave situations I've experienced, both programs retain full use off transport controls (so you can switch between the two and edit seemlessly.) \n However, this is a feature you want to use for a few reasons. You can record incoming audio from reason instead of exporting while accomplishing the same thing (a saved version of audio). However, this audio (if you have auto-warp enabled) will already be perfectly warped to your tempo, and you won't have to do any tweaking later should you want to change said tempo (sometimes, particularly with weird sounding loops, ableton has difficulty getting a proper auto-warp, and manual adjusting needs to happen.) \n Also, you can [completely bypass the reason mixer,]( and hook all of your devices up directly to reason's hardware interface, setting each device into a seperate ableton track, utilizing BOTH reason fx AND ableton FX on each of your sounds. \n Trust me, it's an ideal setup.

Is that the argument? If so then I completely understand and support that. TWs should not be used when you only mean it metaphorically. I totally agree it should only ever be used in a literal sense. \n But it also seems like a large part of the argument is that people use it - and not metaphorically but literally - for things that are too nonserious and things that don't/shouldn't trigger anyone. I saw, for instance, the example of TW for the word \"bitch\" used in the content as a nonserious TW which cheapens the usage of TWs. I don't like this, because it gets us into the terriroty of deciding what is allowed to trigger whom, and I am not convinced that using TWs for something we consider mildly offensive causes any harm. \n I'd like to inject a personal anecdote into all this dry theory. I've never been great at knowing myself, tracking my emotions, knowing that I am angry or sad when I am angry or sad. I was just never taught to pay attention to these things, because the culture I come from isn't a very individualisti culture, individual feelings and emotions just aren't valued much. I also deeply internalized both the sexist idea that women shouldn't show anger AND the more modern/western idea that \"cool\" women (the type that hang out with dudes and are cool with everything) don't get ruffled or personally offended ever. Because of this, noticing and naming and owning my feelings about things or conversations or people is relatively new to me, as new as serious feminism is. \n So I don't know if the way I feel sometimes when I see certain topics being discussed a certain way can be called triggered. I feel like a phony when I say I was triggered, because no professional has diagnosed me. \n And yet. Trigger warnings have been IMMENSELY useful to me to steer clear of certain topics. Just last week, I saw a trigger warning for domestic abuse  and noped out of the thread without clicking on the link. I went back later when I felt more prepared and I am so. freaking. glad.

This here is what's wrong with this whole argument. \n Your case as well as the OP's is entirely contingent upon veiling being a woman's choice - or at least as much of a choice as make-up is for western women. I have no doubt that this is the case for SOME muslims. And I support their choice, because it IS a choice. \n But the way western feminists and privileged muslims like to insist that it is a real choice for all or a majority of muslims is fucking disgusting. \n The conversation about hijabs is entirely dominated entirely by people who have either never worn the hijab or people who have chosen to wear it by choice. These people are BY DEFINITION the  privileged  set. The vast majority of muslims women who wear the hijab are  forced  to do so, and their voices are completely absent from this conversation. \n Why doesn't this bother anyone? Why is everybody fine with erasing these people's existence, and pretending we don't ever need to talk about how they're being denied the right to wear what they like? \n Again, let me remind you, this is the VAST MAJORITY of muslim women we're talking about here, who do not have a choice, who if they \"chose\" to take off their hijabs tomorrow morning, would be immediately and completely ostracized, denounced, excommunicated by their family and community. At best! At worst, they are beaten, thrown in jail, raped, subject to acid attacks, etc etc etc. To compare their experience to western women's makeup choice is  so fucking offensive , I cannot even begin to tell you. \n Now, I fully understand that muslims who live in western countries or other privileged muslims DO face Islamophobia. Their problems are real. I understand completely their need to assert their muslim identities with pride, and how many of them might choose to assert it by wearing hijabs. I support their right to wear hijabs, and to an extent I also support their choice. \n The problem comes when we fail to see that there are TWO DISTINCT ISSUES affecting TWO DISTINCT SETS OF PEOPLE here. One issue is the right of western-or-otherwise-privileged muslim women to be able to choose to wear hijabs without becoming the target of Islamophobia. \n But the other issue - the right of the vast majority of muslim women to dress as they please without being coerced by their families, communities, and governments to dress \"modestly\", cover themselves up, and essentially cut themselves off from public life in the process - is even MORE fundamental, an even BIGGER and MORE EGREGIOUS violation of muslim women's rights. \n Therefore, to pretend it does not exist, to never talk about it, to have every conversation about it get hijacked by privileged muslims wanting to talk about the first issue is OUTRAGEOUSLY OFFENSIVE. \n We  should  be talking about the first issue, certainly. Far be it from me to silence the relatively privileged but still oppressed western/rich muslims from speaking against Islamophobia in the west. But we should not be talking about it the way we are talking about it now: in ways that erase the existence of the second issue completely.", "On a complete tangent, how is it that people always find like the perfect gif for every conversation?

You're right, I'm coming at this from a position of huge privilege, and you are spot on with the water supply criticism. \n I can claim some inside perspective, though, because when I first hit puberty my family could not afford sanitary napkins either (even though we were far from underprivileged). I spent several years using pieces of cloth. Even now if I buy regular napkins or tampons I feel a twinge of guilt for spending on disposable luxuries. \n So having  somewhat  been-there-done-that, plus being quite familiar with the penny-pinching ways of third world countries, and also having experienced some water scarcity, I still feel that buying napkins and tampons for these girls is a very cosmetic solution ... perhaps an overly first-world solution.

But this argument from ignorance that you are making.... surely you recognize that absence of evidence is not evidence of  presence ? Even if I accept every word you are saying in the spirit that it is intended, the  best  we can say is we don't know anything at all about whether women batter men. But you seem to be suggesting that somehow it adds up to \"men are probably battered by women just as much as women are battered by men\". \n In any case, we DO know something about whether women batter men, if not from government statistics (oh yes they do exist) then from observing society: \n \n We know that men in general are not and never have been prevented from working outside the home (thus ensuring outside-world contact) and having their own income. This one factor alone assures us that what keeps the vast majority of battered women trapped does not apply to men at all, and hugely reduces the likelihood of men staying in violent relationships. \n \n We know that women in general are physically weaker than men. So men are seldom in fear of women overpowering them and killing them, or hurting them very badly. ( In general. Please don't counter with particular cases. ) Another factor that vastly reduces the likelihood of men being battered. \n \n We know that most men have not been socialized to fear female physical violence to an unreasonable extent. The very fact that most men are brought up to consider women weak and to casually brush off physical fights/violence/injuries, though questionable in itself, allows most men to escape much of the psychological terror that, for women, goes along with being hit by a member of the opposite sex. This reduces the possibility that men can be bullied into staying in a relationship with the threat of violence from a woman. \n \n Taboos never work quite as well as you seem to think. Yes, men are certainly taught never to be caught confessing to being a victim. But similarly, women had always been taught never to complain about their home lives, never to say a word against their husbands, never to air their dirty laundry in public, etc. Those taboos used to be just as strong scarcely a generation ago... AND YET, the existence of domestic violence against women has never been a secret, not for hundreds and hundreds of years! Those taboos I mentioned still exist today in ridiculously strong forms in places other than the US, but even in those places in social circles it is usually well known which husbands beat which wives. Domestic violence is simply not easy to hide.  We would have heard of men getting battered by women long before MRAs came into existence if the problem actually existed on a widespread scale. \n \n \n So,", "This was so awesome! I applaud it. \n I know it's fashionable among some very privileged muslim women these days to say that wearing a hijab is \"empowering\", and that people who urge muslim women to take it off are pressuring them to conform to western beliefs and interfering with free choice and whatnot. That sounds like total bullshit though since  nobody  would be wearing the hijab at all if it wasn't forced on them to begin with. \n Neither is the hijab desirable as an expression of muslim identity, since no article of clothing should determine how true a muslim you are... especially no  gendered  article of clothing. To the extent that muslims are willing to support this sexist division between what body parts men and women are allowed to bare, I have no problems condeming their interpretation of Islam. I criticise the sexualization and forced covering up of female breasts in western culture - this is the same thing many times worse. \n And while I understand how it might be hard for many women to let go of something they've been used to wearing for all their lives, there's really no question that taking it off is  better .

Nike workers get paid almost nothing, parents get paid literally nothing. Nike workers would stop making an irresponsible number of shoes if only the CEO allowed them to do so. People would stop making so many children if only women were more empowered (look it up: fertility rates drop dramatically when people stop exploiting women). \n > I don't see how a few years of service (or even a lifetime) are equivalent to producing too many children. \n Wow, just look at the terminology used to describe the two activities.

One person's too many kids doesn't actually do much harm all by itself. Drop in the bucket. \n On an aggregate level, all people's military service is the sole reason why wars happen at all. We would have world peace if people just stopped being soldiers. Utopia! On an aggregate level, the worst that happens with too many kids is people fight over resources... Necessarily small scale battles in the absence of organized militaries, lol. And if people stopped having kids on an aggregate level, society collapses tomorrow.

I'm not going to lie, it was both good and bad and I understand that now. She was clinically diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder. After finding that out she decided she did not want to take medicine, claiming there was nothing wrong with her. Following that multiple instances of anger and violence insued. She moved in with me and my family post her graduation, we were initially going to move out solo but she decided against it. After she moved in things turned ugly.

I had to drop everyone in my life and stupidly I did. I wouldn't have had an issue with it if she wasn't sending selfies to them and general flirting.

We have a small argument that ends with her staying she doesn't want to date me.

I had gotten gold (after playing for 3 or 4 weeks) and I was starting to play players that weren't completely awful. (only semi-awful). \n Well I ended up losing a bunch, got annoyed and tried off-racing...got even more annoyed. I ended up just taking a slight break and collecting myself. I watched some pro replays, looked at what they did. I always just reminded myself that if these guys can take on pros like this than I can take on some random, no-name scrub just fine. \n I refined my builds and thought hard about the issues I had. For me my biggest issue was simply that of a unit composition one. I would build a ton of sentries versus a marine/marauder ball. I didn't really have a good concept of what mix of units to build. \n I ended up just working on my macro-game one match up at a time. That matchup happened to be PvT. That was the only matchup where I would play a straight up macro game, at least 2-3 base. PvP and PvZ were strictly 1 base affairs. The way I viewed it is I have seen pros lose to one base builds. I know it sounds weird but start small. \n For me the pressure and just sheer difficulty of suddenly playing a straight macro game in every matchup seemed impossible. I would lose games due to stupid mistakes such as forgetting upgrades until it was too late or floating way too many minerals doing a FE. Limiting my 'macro' game to one standard early build against one standard opponent, well, it helped. \n And you know what? Playing those short, 1 base games helped as well. I won most of them and they helped me refine my builds. They helped me know when to pull back on the aggression and tech up and they improved my micro. \n Anyways now just a couple of weeks later and I am playing and beating diamond level players. My PvT now is pretty strong and I macro vs them well. My next order of business is to work on my PvZ macro.", "Sadly when some casters like Wolf or Tastosis do this people criticize them for \"not making the game exciting enough\".

After all the thing people drill into others heads is  always make workers . That concept still holds plenty of weight with zerg but it is a bit more complicated than that. For a newer player it can be really difficult to understand when your opponent is going to attack. \n I think the biggest thing newbie zerg players forget in regards to drones vs units is that it is very possible to wait until the last moment to pop out an army to defend certain timings. See their army moving out? Ok, just pop a bunch of units instead of drones. Of course this takes good mechanics because you need to keep up on injects which hurts new players.", "Who cares. \n This is the same thing as the 'are games art' debate. It doesn't matter.

They simply  can't  go and harass your expansions for fear of a big muta ball wrecking their mineral line. What this means is you can freely drone up and expand with pretty much no worries at all. \n Also I feel like phoenix is becoming more and more popular in the matchup (to deal with infestors by lifting them up) and mutas kind of fuck them up. \n As a toss player I cringe every time I see a zerg going heavy muta.

They still support them through the in-game spectator system, but Valve are not actively paying for every major Dota 2 tournament out there. Riot, for the most part, is. \n Of course it is questionable (and no one really knows) how far LoL would have gotten without the immense amount of momentary support from Riot. I guess you could say the same thing about Valve and the International (after all, the first International brought over a ton of teams to Dota 2 right away) as well. \n Either way I guess I just see Riot as 'buying into' the scene because they quite literally are. Meanwhile I think Valve is supporting the scene but through creating a quality product. They run the International every year but beyond that aren't really paying to get into tournaments and such. \n So I guess", "You've got almost exactly a 50% win rate, what's the problem?

No one cares if you have the \"least deaths\" on your team . Congratulations, you didn't die as much. What does that mean? Not a whole lot. In your weaver example you still just had shit for items (40 minute game and just a manta). It didn't matter if you died only a few times because you weren't useful. \n B.

The chances that someone will just get outplayed or out laned in at least  one  lane is high. \n C. No matter what skill level you are at there will always be feeders.  This is the thing no one seems to fucking get. There is no magical fucking wonderland where people shit rainbows and play perfect. People feed. Everyone does. The thing is, just because a player is good enough to be in a very high MMR bracket doesn't mean they are immune to feed. Against you and your normal mode dudes? Yeah, definitely.

I'm totally fine with a game that focuses on the story and , as such, isn't too difficult to beat. I actually tend to play single player games on medium -- unless it is a game I feel really benefits from the higher difficulty. \n My \"hardcore\" games are games that I can really sink my teeth into. Currently that would be Dota 2, but it's certainly not the only one. MMOs with a strong PvP aspect to them I love (Lineage 2 one of my favorites) and I was a huge fan of Starcraft 2 as well. \n The only sort of exception to this rule is Dark Souls and Demon Souls,  but even then they technically are multiplayer as PvP becomes my focus after I play through the game. \n Anyways", "I just wanted to point out that you don't really understand dota-like games. \n >The first issue with a noob on one team is a constant 5:4 'power play', which already makes the game much more difficult for the team with the noob or let's say less experienced player. \n Not really an issue, because Dota is built around competitive play -- not pub play. \n >The second issue is a 'rich get richer' scenario with 'exponential' gain. If one team plays really well, the game gets progressively easier for them, to the point where they steamroll their enemies, but most likely don't have enough power to rush through the static defenses, it gets even worse the more they push, because naturally the other team gets pushed back and is forced to turtle more closely to whatever they have to defend. So, depending on the game, a match can be 'over' after 10-15 mins, but it still takes another 30-40 mins to end it or until a 'doomsday device'can be bought/kicks in to end it without having to break a turtle defense. \n You are ridiculously over simplifying this, first off. You completely ignore possible team compositions in regards to snowballing. \n Yes, if a team focused around making it to the late game gets a strong start it is going to get easier for them. It's the point of their entire strategy. In many ways it  shouldn't  happen unless the other team gets out played. \n If a team is much more focused on early game control and ganks or pushes they are destined to get an early lead. What happens though is that their heroes end up not scaling as well as the enemy, and this is where comebacks are possible. \n Also if a game is actually over at 10-15 minutes (it rarely is, unless it is a complete stomp) it's not going to take a team 30-40 more minutes to end. The only times this will happen is if they have a heavy late game lineup and just don't bother forcing the issue (since they wouldn't need to). \n >And now you combine these terrible designed 'steamroll' mechanics with a noob/less experienced player (or a player that's forced to play a roll/character he isn't comfortable with) and you realize that this one player now has the 'power' to spin the game completely out of control by making several mistakes, which makes all the other players very angry, because they waste 30-40 mins to lose a game without doing anything wrong. This anger gets even more amplified by mechanics that punish players for dropping out of games, because if they leave a game that WILL be lost with 100% certainty in 30 minutes, then they'll get banned for an hour without being able to play at all. \n One player playing poorly is not going to suddenly 'spin everything out of control'. \n Sometimes players get put into bad lanes. It happens, and often times is a strategical decision. Just because they start off 0/3 doesn't mean the game is wasted away, it just means that you are hopefully getting and finding your farm and levels on other (more important) heroes. \n Also leaving a game doesn't  ban  you, Jesus Christ. If you leave too many times it puts you in low priority for Dota. Leaving is a dick thing to do anyways, and in low skill pubs literally anything can happen in regards to comebacks. \n > I get the appeal of MOBAs, but they're still terrible, because of a lack of comeback mechanics. There's only a very short time frame, where you can make up for a mistake, make a few more and the game is already lost, because at that point it has nothing to do with skill..one side simply has gear&abilities, that are completely OP. \n There are comeback mechanics, but you need to draft for it. If you go for a strategy which is very focused on trying to win early and get crushed early it is  your fault  for not having any way to comeback. \n It's like complaining that players who go all in in Starcraft 2 don't have any 'comeback' potential. Of course they don't, because they planned it that way. \n >I don't get why none of them try new stuff. \n With Dota it's because people  want it that way . I fucking love Dota, and I love just about everything about the way it is designed. \n As far as other people, they're just trying to get easy money and are too afraid to step away from the model (in most cases its them trying to copy League).", "I dislike how some companies do it. Valve does it well with TF2 (and hopefully Dota 2) where it is purely cosmetic items. Even better the community gets in on the action through the steam workshop, which is great. \n Of course I'm not so sure that every f2p game can go that route because they don't have the popularity that Valve games do. \n I dislike f2p games that end up cutting you off from a ton of content though behind a paywall. That's not f2p, it's an extended demo. Like some of these \"f2p\" MMOs where you end up paying for more classes, dungeons, areas.... it's kind of silly. \n So I really think it should just be cosmetic stuff only under a paywall. I understand the need to do other things but I'm not really a fan. At least some games get around it by rotating out a \"roster\" (such as LoL) but other games such as Tribes  really  suffers from this. You're a lot weaker and have very few options without grinding your heart out or paying money. \n Hell even in LoL while you can't buy runes or w/e you end up running into this choice where you can either spend your points on new heroes or runes. It sucks. It means that a player either needs to buy the heroes that they want or be gimped compared to everyone else because you don't have as many runes. The heroes in LoL aren't interesting enough to play for an extended period of time too, so I found myself generally not having any runes when I tried the game in the past. (And it took quite a while to get a new hero, meh.)", "Sega really just took a few too many risks and then gambled on the wrong type of hardware when the Saturn came around. \n The biggest problem with the Saturn was that, like I mentioned earlier, sega gambled on the wrong kind of hardware. The Saturn was an absolute  beast  at rendering 2D. Just look at the 2D fighting games of the time, the Saturn versions were always the best compared to the PS1. \n Of course the problem was that 3D became the big thing and the Saturn was absolutely awful at 3D. \n It was too bad honestly because, as a Saturn owner, I loved the system. It had some great games and the system its self was solid. The internal memory was nice as well, because it meant you had no need for a memory card. Also the controllers were some of the best out there for 2D/Fighting games. (some pros still use saturn USB controllers today for fighting tournaments). \n So the Saturn ended up not selling as well and Sega sort of rushed out the Dreamcast at an odd time.  (they needed to) . It was released half a year before the PS2  (sept 1999 for dreamcast, march 2000 for PS2) . \n Now, I do think that the Dreamcast actually had a lot of advantages over the PS2. Even though the hardware was released earlier it was actually really powerful, and Sega's gamble on focusing around online content ended up paying off very well at first. The system had some incredible games for it and everything was looking great. \n But, of course, the PS2 ended up coming along finally and just crushed it. Even though the Dreamcast had a lot of great games, it didn't have a lot of good  mainstream  games. EA, for example, had some sort of exclusivity thing with Sony on sports titles (IIRC) which meant that Sega had no Madden or anything like that. Also the dual shock ended  up being a better controller for 3D titles where the Dreamcast only had the one analog. \n In the end it was just Sony's great third party support that ended up letting them dominate the Dreamcast so easily. Really, there was just not much of a reason to pick up the Dreamcast for most people over a PS2. (which was unfortunate really).", "As someone who was a huge fan of MMORPGs, the genre really is just in a rut right now. \n Your best bet would be Guild Wars 2, probably. They're one of the only people trying something different that aren't a tiny indie company or EVE Online. I don't play the game, personally, but it's a well made game. \n For the most part though a majority of MMOs are just fucking stale and boring. When a game such as FF14 gets praise something is seriously wrong with the competition. \n WoW probably is still a pretty decent choice as well, and they'll probably have that new expansion pack out in 6 months time or so. For as much copying as people try to do WoW still is on a different level. (And I wasn't even a huge WoW person, honestly). \n Personally I would just wait for something else though, unless you're really chomping at the bit to play another MMO. The Elder Scrolls Online seems like it  might  be a decent choice, and you've got games like Wildstar coming \"soon\" as well. Hopefully we'll hear more about Everquest Next as well soon -- because that game sounds incredibly promising."]}]}

Not the literal, \"All humans have died\", but humanity (the spiritual essence) has become so diluted over the centuries that its more or less gone.

There were smaller, and smaller, and smaller pieces of the Dark Soul left as time went on. \n This also raises the interesting question. Why is it people are losing their memory when they Hollow? Hollowing used to just drive you insane. It didnt mean you lost your memory, but instead lost what made you human, your Humanity (literally). With the Dark Soul gone, and Humanity basically nonexistent, the Curse feeds on something else. Your history, your memories, thus feeding on who you are, your \"Humanity\", even when the Spiritual Sprite that was Humanity is gone. \n This is why Effigies restore your \"Humanity\". When you use one, you are looking back at yourself. You see your history, your actions, your physical being and its footprints through history.

So far, little is as obvious as it seems. \n Their full introduction reads: \n \n The Hylotl, a proud amphibious species, were concerned with beauty. It's what drove them, the pursuit of perfection. Through years of living under the ocean, they developed empathy towards all other species, with a strong desire to reach out and save all living things.\nAs such, they were pacifists and herbivores, content to simply live in peace until one day they were forced out of their homes, and off-world entirely, by the dreaded Floran menace.\" \n \n When i read this, it feels... wrong. Why would the Floran suddenly decide to invade a planet and drive the Hylotl (who live underwater no less, probably making it a great challange) off of it? The Floran love to hunt, but full on war doesnt seem to be their style. \"The Pursuit of Perfect\" also sounds a bit... evil, though it could mean anything. \n The Hyltol's other lore mentions a \"Directive 0451\". \n \n Be discerning. Be polite. And remember Directive 0451. If you do not know what Directive 0451 is, then do not worry about it. Or ask about it. Just do your job, okay?\" \n \n Of course, we dont know what Directive 0451 is (hopefully we will soon!). But, im guessing it has to do with the history behind Floran and Hyltol. Its strange how Floran  hate  Hylotl for seemingly no reason. If they were willing to invade planets to drive the inhabitants away, you'd assume it would mean they're aggressive enough to go to war with the other species as well. But theres no mention of war or open combat with the other races, only the occasional hunting of their travelers. \n My theory at the moment is that Hyltol were eating Floran, whom put an end to it and ended up getting the brunt of the blame for all the wrong reasons. The Floran  only  show open hostility to Hyltol, and there must be some reason for it. As uneducated and illogical as the Floran are, they're a rather nice species as a whole that welcomes everyone with open arms (and the occasional open mouth).", "If you're looking for a game that will give you direction, then yes.

Ice cream can easily be \"too cold.\" There is a highish temperature at which it stays icy but is comfortable, and it can get  much  colder than that, deep into very painfully cold temperatures, and of course it just stays ice creamy. The natural solution is to warm up your ice cream a bit! Consider that the air around you is warmer than the ice cream. Consider that the air inside you is MUCH warmer than the ice cream. When a warm thing and a cold thing move past each other, the warm thing gets cooler and the cold thing gets warmer.

It took longer for the spoiled and selfish, but by the time I was a teenager I had it mostly handled. I wasn't giving, but I wasn't selfish either. \n Next I decided that I was still too fearful (pussyboy) despite not longer being whiny, and I had that under wraps about halfway through high school. As a result of becoming hard, I had also becoming a brooding and angsty teenager, so I worked on being a little more friendly. \n Over the years I've learned to take more risks, I've learned to take initiative, I've learned how to have comic timing, I've learned how to listen to people, I've learned when to take words to heart and when to let them slide off, and all sorts of other little things that I decided I wanted to be able to pull off. \n Right now I'm working on being easier to talk to. I'm still just a little bit awkward during that period of trying to find common ground with the person you are meeting, and I'd like to smooth that out by being like those really smooth sociable people that just always seem pleasant to interact with.

Note that I, like everyone else, really really want for Blizzard to include offline play, but let me play the role of the devil for a moment for the sake of providing the whole picture. \n People don't understand how difficult and costly it is to develop A) A high quality LAN option and B) A high quality server-based option. It used to be very simple, but these technologies are drifting further and further apart, making them two entirely different projects. Can you really justify doing both if only a small portion of your customers will be using one of them? It costs a lot of time and money to put in these features, and it would mean taking on another layer of maintenance and support (which blizz has always been AMAZING about keeping up with). \n Also, forcing always-online DOES mean that cheating and duping will be GONE. \"But it didn't matter in -\" No fuck you, that was 15 years ago.

Again, I  personally  feel that in single player I should have the right to cheat if I want to on my own time, but I understand what they are trying to do. It will work, too. \n So, instead of me saying \"we have to suck it down\" I'll use this information to show you what we can do. For any and all online characters, blizzard WILL require a constant internet connection. I think that this is pretty reasonable. However, the only reason we aren't getting unlocked single player and LAN is because blizz feels they can't justify the cost of adding and supporting those features. The question is, are they right or wrong? If the cost truly is too great for a small subset of consumers, then we can't really fault them for eating unnecessary expenses.

Sometimes forced.", "There are two real problems underneath all the other problems that must be solved before anything can be improved. I'm going to outline them, and you're all going to realize how difficult the road ahead is going to be. \n Problem #1: Shareholders are ignorant \nMost big game companies are owned by shareholders, and these shareholders often don't know jack shit about videogames. They do know an awful lot about how to run a profitable business, and they know a lot about how to exploit Problem #2 (we'll come to that soon). \n Shareholders are sincerely only concerned with money, and you can't really fault them for that. You don't buy a share in a successful company because you like them, you buy a share because you are trying to make an investment and you want to get a return. Because they don't understand videogames, they can't afford to take any risks on innovation or improving PR. They know the business ideas that have been historically successful, and they can't risk trying anything else. It's their bread and butter. \n Until shareholders acquire a better understanding of why seemingly risky games (Minecraft, Quake Live, DDO, even Skyrim) are so successful in this particular market, they will continue to approach problems with old ideas that - while basically successful in terms of profit - ultimately hold back the industry and prevent themselves from making more money. \n This problem, it should be noted, is why companies like Valve and Blizzard are redonkulously successful. The idiocy of massive publicly owned companies allowed them to monopolize the things that gamers actually want. \n Problem #2: Gamers are ignorant \nYou may be thinking, \"I'm a gamer! This is something I can do something about!\" No. You are someone that reads r/gaming. The average gamer is a 30-year old guy with a blue collar job that comes home to play CoD online with his 30-year old work buddies. They one-up each other with DLC and achievements. They drink cheap beer while they play and they think you're a fukkin nub sniper. They are basically equivalent to the 10-year olds that are also playing CoD. \n This is a direct result of videogames becoming so popular over the past 10 years. Games really aren't just for nerds anymore, if you doubt me, look at Cliffy B. Games like Madden, CoD, Battlefield (yes, Battlefield), FIFA, and even stuff like Wii Fit, in combination with believable graphics and increased accessibility, has brought videogames eye-level with the average joe. \n As we are all well-aware, the average joe is  fucking stupid . Or, as I said in the title of the problem, ignorant. The average joe is greatly concerned with having the limited edition DLC shotgun with the wings and the bikini woman decal on it that none of his friends have. The average joe likes his limited selection of games so much that a $20 map pack is exactly what he's in the market for. The average joe does not play minecraft, does not know what DRM is, and does not know or care who develops or publishes his favorite games. The average joe has disposable income and will spend it on whatever he god damn feels like. \n This problem will never be solved, because gaming is now at the point where it will be forever: A fun thing that the mainstream enjoys here and there, and a smaller collection of hobbyists (That's us!) are heavily involved in. The mainstream is going to dictate the direction of the majority of the industry. Just because we love games more than most people does not make our dollars any more valuable. In short, we must accept that mainstream-targeted games will always come with annoying marketing ploys to get a little extra money out of your wallet. They're good games, and we'll keep playing them, we'll just have to share the burden. But we still have tons of awesome little studios, and even big private studios, that will continue to innovate, push games forward as an art, and deliver on new ideas that excite those of us that remember beating Mega Man 2.", "How do you know the player will approach at the correct angle, and how do you know how quickly they will turn? \n Even if the passage is made very narrow, how do you know they player won't walk backwards into the item? You would have to force them to face it. Interacting with an object is a good solution, but that has been done to death. Interact with thing, change happens. Big whoop. I want a change that seems to happen out of nowhere. Same goes for forcing the camera on the object for a time. No one is going to be surprised if the level changes during that time when the player has no control. \n Also, you don't know how fast the player will turn around. You can try to distract them with something, but there is no guarantee they will pay attention. You could begin the change while they are moving towards the object, but what if they turn around? What if they turn around faster than their computer can process the change? \n Computers just aren't fast enough yet for you to reliably make big changes in such a way that the player is guaranteed not to see them. The only way you ever have changes happening in a game is when control is in some way forced out of the players hands, or they are forcibly refused to see what is changing until it is done."]}, {"subreddit": "Games", "posts": ["IWBTG is a perfectly fair and balanced Trial & Error platformer.

But it does use one at the very start (both in the original and Gaiden) to introduce you to the fact that this game wants to fuck you. It thinks you look real purdy, and it wants to fuck you hard. These time wasters almost never appear again, as there is no point in sending a redundant and unfun message. The massive amount of time poured into the game comes from learning the traps and mastering the pixel-perfect maneuvers necessary to avoid them. \n An example of a less awesome IWBTG style game is IWBTBoshy. The hit detection is intentionally(?) horrible. This is for the sake of \"being trollsy lolololol\" but it really sucks the fun out of a game that would otherwise be an amazing successor to the original. \n Other IWBTG spinoffs have huge timesinks or ridiculously long segments without saves, again for the sake of being trollsy lolololol. Nobody plays these games, you may have noticed. \n The brilliance of IWBTG's design is that it makes you  feel  like the game is out to get you, but really it's completely fair and anything that kills you twice is because YOU failed.

It really depends on the type of game. Some games are built around the concept of trial & error, and that's okay. The important thing is that the game knows what its goals are and is consistent with them. \n There are plenty of classic platformers that throw things at you faster than you can react, sometimes you have to know the danger is coming in advance because you can't get out of the way even with perfect reaction times. In these cases, part of the game is memorization. If you accept memorization as a game mechanic, then failure states are inevitable. It can still be fun and \"feel fair\" if the loop is fast enough that you can jump back in and use that knowledge quickly. \n I think consistency is the most important bit. \nIf mistakes are punished hard but in a consistent manner, then the game is hard but fair. If mistakes are sometimes punished and sometimes not, then the game is actually easier, but it  feels  unfair because the player is never given a clear idea of what \"perfect play\" actually is.

If I annoyed someone a bit and they shrugged it off, then I wouldn't annoy them any further. If they overreact? No relenting until they respond in a mature manner. Basically, \"I'm gonna do something immature. If you respond in an equally immature manner, I'm going to keep wasting your time.\" Often times in these situations, if a GM ended up being called, the GM would tell the \"victim\" to just... go somewhere else? Get some friends and kill the griefer? It's a big world with a lot of options, nothing is being exploited, deal with it like an adult. \n Even these days, if I see someone who takes a game waaay too seriously, I will jump on any opportunity to punish them for their skewed perceptions.

I also agree that SC2 is more taxing on an individual player, but just because a game is less difficult doesn't mean that it automatically doesn't deserve to be an eSport. Tennis is less taxing than Rugby, but requires enough skill and athleticism to be an equally competitive sport. \n DotA is a great example of a MOBA that I hope to see in more tourneys. It has a shot at taking down LoL, and I believe the truly good players will leave LoL for DotA2 over time. LoL has the problem that it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be casual-friendly or hardcore-competitive. You can try to balance them, but one will always be sacrificed for the other. I feel in LoL's case they sacrifice competitiveness for marketability, which is a smart move on their part right now, but they're going to have to slow down and focus more on balance rather than new content or people will start to figure out that the game is perpetually broken."]}, {"subreddit": "funny", "posts": ["There is a deeper question here that no one seems to realize is what makes us disagree on this sort of stuff. \n How confident are you that human beings are capable of creating and managing a government that makes vigilantes unnecessary? \n Your answer, Puppetless, would be \"very confident.\" Others are not so confident. Unfortunately this is not a question that is easily answered by logic or science, as it has too much to do with our own poorly understood human psychology and culture. \n When people react to this story, they react either very strongly against the vigilantes, or very strongly in favor. The reason they react that way is because of their confidence level and trust in government. It is NOT a slippery slope problem. It is NOT a corruption problem. It is the core problem that that has plagued this nation for many years, asking the question, \"Should a local community be allowed to handle their shit without oversight?\" \n I personally think it is far more complicated than \"we should allow it\" or \"we should not allow it.\" It really depends on the culture and environment in which you live. I believe that for the people of Rankin county, Mississippi, this is what they need. The same approach would not fly in a large metropolis, where any sign of corruption is much too dangerous and frightening to allow. Anyone who has been involved in law enforcement in a small town and a big city can tell you how differently things need to operate due to public attitude.

Red tape and law books means we are protected by protocol, but also slaves to it (\"I touched his arm and he sued me for battery\") while rambo six-shooter sheriffs mean we are trusting our safety to the conscience of those in power.

It was the most miserable time of my life. Every morning I felt nauseous, and came close to vomiting due to the stress of how precarious all the events that kept me floating were. The kindness of others. Odd jobs. A fortuitously cheap hole in the wall. I had no health insurance, no safety net, and - due to being so busy and generally irritable - no friends. \n I finally gathered enough stability to re-enter college. \n More retail, more odd jobs, steadily increasing debt. \n I graduate Summa Cum Laude, with many accolades and honors, from a Computer Science and Mathematics program. \n My tough-as-nails-genius r\u00e9sum\u00e9 lands me a wonderful job.

I may even rise to the 1% eventually, as I have already begun to invest my disposable income. But there is only one valedictorian per school.

Meaning, the vast majority of it is absolute shit.  Look through your TV listings and figure out what percentage of live action shows you would actually watch.

I would say I do like metal because that genre makes up nearly 50% of my music library, and a good chunk of it is actually not very good but I like it anyway. In the west you can say \"I like anime\" and mean that you like a handful of anime shows because they are just good shows. In Japan if you say \"I like anime\" you mean it makes up a large percentage of everything you watch because Sailor Mercury makes your dick hard. \n Also, as someone who was a little bit of anime fanatic in my younger years, I can explain why that happens: I saw Dragon Ball Z, and my developing energetic little boy mind said \"FUCKING AWESOME!\" I saw Sailor Moon and my developing horny tween penis said \"FUCKING AWESOME!\" So I spent a long time trying to find more fucking awesome, incorrectly believing that DBZ and Sailor Moon interested me because they were anime.

However, I don't think this means I dislike sports. \n Now, on the other hand, I love watching eSports. I love some more than others. SC2 is my worst game, but it's the one I watch the most. Why? Honestly, I think it's because I identify with the personalities and culture surrounding it the most. I'm much better at fighters and FPS games, but the Fighter culture is so horrifically juvenile, and the FPS scene is full of ragers and commentators that don't know wtf they're talking about. \n As a good example, I tried watching an NBA Highlights Reel a while back. It was literally a bunch of 2-second long clips of either dunks or 3-pointers spliced together with dramatic music. No context. Those aren't fucking highlights! I want to see an entire play, from one team gaining possession of the ball to scoring, I want to see why that particular play or show of athleticism was uncanny.

Let's go. Let's do this Roxanne. \n BUT OH GOD I'M HORRIBLY UNDERLEVELED. \n The Geodudes fall easy (duh) but then, Nosepass. Rock Tomb. My Wingull dies, and so does my Treecko. Dustox can't even get an attack off. Pain shoots through my whole body, as those were my two favorites. Now I'm left with a Taillow which is so dead to Rock Tomb, a Poochyena, and a level 7 Nincada, Kyle, which I didn't bother training (what good would it do against Roxanne anyways?) So I send out the Taillow to see if I can't get a couple hits off. Wing Attack. Rock Tomb. Dead, and I barely left a scratch. Alright Gina, here we go. Sorry you had to watch everyone else die before you did. I click \"fight\" and then I see it. Sand Attack. It's not much of a chance but it is indeed something. Alright, let's do this. Sand Attack. Nosepass misses. Sand Attack. Nosepass misses. Sand Attack. Miss. Sand Attack. Miss. I got 4 of them in before a Rock Tomb ended Gina's life. So it's Kyle's turn to die. At this point, I'm already thinking about my next nuzlocke and how I'm definitely picking Torchic this time, fuck. But then something weird happens. Nosepass uses tackle. Can it be? Is she out of Rock Tombs? I wouldn't be surprised, Gina ate a ton of them. So I start scratching. Is there a chance? My level 7 nincada can beat this level 14 Nosepass that just swept my whole team? Scratch. Miss. Scratch. Miss. This happens several times. She gets to the red. Two more and this happens, it actually happens. Then, suddenly, POTION! NO FUCK NO. I was so close... Nosepass used tackle! Down to red for Kyle. I use a potion. It's not over yet. \n Scratch. Miss. Scratch. Miss. The occasional tackle only brings me to a little over half (this Nincada has ridiculous defense), so I use one of a shitton of potions I have and keep spamming scratch. Many turns pass, and I get Nosepass down to the red again. She's out of potions, she already used one on the Nosepass back when Treecko was alive. The Nosepass has been usning Harden too, so it's at max defense. I just have to get there before it starts Struggling. Scratch. Down to 1. Nosepass uses tackle! It misses! Nosepass uses Tackle! It Misses! Kyle uses Scratch! Nosepass fainted!!! \n I did it. Kyle did it. Beat a Nosepass with a level 7, freshly caught Nincada.

Lol'd at Wattson as a Makuhita (I had a solid team back by that point) ate his Voltorb's selfdestruct, killed the Magneton and Lyle lol'd at the rest while Fury Cutter got crazy. I only took Lyle out for the important battles, the ones where he could break the game. He proceeds to lol at half of Norman, Juan, and a good chunk of the Elite Four. My rule was that I couldn't have both Lyle and Kyle in my party at the same time, but could switch freely between the two. Eventually I \"boxed\" Kyle, although I imagined he was with me the whole time as a partner that didn't want to battle anymore. Lyle became way underleveled, but it didn't matter.

Bloodrush is instant speed but the creature has to be \"attacking\". That means he it has to be during the combat phase and has to have been declared an attacker. There's 2 chances to pump with a bloodrush creature. Right after you say \"attacking\" or right after they declare blockers. Theoretically, you could bloodrush after the damage is dealt during this weird part of combat called \"End Combat\" where attacking creatures are still \"attacking\" but damage has been dealt. Though I can't see any advantage in doing so. \n You can do anything else you'd do at instant speed while domri's ability is on the stack. That means the fight hasn't happened yet. Let me break down the stack for you or any other new players reading this and confused. \n When Domri's ability is activated during your main phase, it goes on the stack before it happens. That gives both players a chance to play instants. So when Domri is -2'd, the stack looks like such: \n \n Domri -2\n \n \n Then both players get \"priority\". You can't do anything if you don't have priority. Even tapping lands or playing instants. Good news is, you get priority before just about everything happens.

Now the stack looks like this. \n \n Battlewise Valor\nDomri -2  \n \n \n Now priority is passed again. Technically, you could cast another Battlewise Valor, but you decide not to and pass priority. Now your opponent gets the chance to respond. He casts Lightning Strike, targeting your creature. The stack now looks like this. \n \n Lightning Strike\nBattlewise Valor\nDomri -2\n \n \n Now you both get priority  again , say you're done playing things, and agree to move on. So things start to \"resolve\", or actually happen. It goes top-down, or for the programmers out there, last-in-first-out. So the lightning strike resolves. State-based-effects are checked before each passing of priority, and sees a 3/3 with 3 damage on it (note - before Battlewise Valor would save it). Your 3/3's dead. Battlewise Valor goes to resolve, sees it's target is dead, and goes \"Welp, that sucks\" and goes to the graveyard. Doesn't even scry. And then Domri's ability tries to fight, but again, the creature is dead, so his ability fizzles too. Unfortunately, since -2 loyalty is part of the cost, he still loses the loyalty.

They started out rushing 4 and they were covering well. 4 man rush was getting enough pressure and it's why Brady was struggling. They also have no run game to speak for, so getting too aggressive isn't necessary. Then for some reason they got really aggressive and Brady/Gronk shredded them for a TD. So they overcompensated and backed off  huge . I seen linebackers dropping back 5-7 yards from the snap, which makes no sense to me against Amendola, Edelman and Gronk who are superstars underneath. If it weren't for the D line going into beast mode and sacking Brady out of FG range, this could very well be a tie game. \n On the other side, the Smith bros were running great routes and the Pats corners were playing too far off. Not even Revis can cover a crossing route when he lines up 6-8 yards back. \n Toward the end of the half, Chung and McCourty stepped up huge. Usually when you play your corners off, Safeties and LBs are expected to pick up the slack underneath. McCourty was late a couple times, but he really stepped it up and took away more than one play. \n Most games are fought in the trenches, but I think this one is being fought in the second level. The game is hinging on the NE safety play, and the Ravens D Line heated up at the end though, and this was becoming less true. If they can keep Brady on the ground, they can slow him down. \n Seems like the offensive play calling on BAL's side has changed too. Elevated safety play has taken away that middle crossing route stuff, and they've been forced to improvise. \n Getting a pick to stop Brady from going down, scoring and getting the ball back is  huge . They finally got paid off for dropping the LBs deep, right as I was writing about how dumb it was. Then they go all the way down and score (albeit off a pretty ticky tacky PI, they're calling it tight so that's gonna keep happening). Massive. \n More toward the trench battle, the Ravens line on the run has been stellar on both sides. Forsett is running through highways, and no matter who NE puts back there he has nowhere to go. Ravens O Line gets a 3 yard push every time too, which is why that 3rd and 1 End Around makes no sense to me. Still, look for a lot of PA in the 2nd half, which is why I actually give the Ravens the edge to win right now even though NE has all the momentum. That injury to the NE RG is massive, you could see the difference right away.", "My baseless educated guesses: \n NFC: \n 1) SEA \n 2) GB \n 3) DAL \n 4) NO \n 5) ARI \n 6) DET \n San Fran falls apart in this little narrative.

Chargers are on fire, and Rivers only gets better in December. Cincinatti is a good team, and I think if the Colts keep playing the way they are, they can run away with their division. FWIW, I think Bortles takes the jags to a 5-11 record from here, and they have hope once again. \n \n Playoffs: \n WILD CARD: \n DAL vs DET: If anyone has a chance to stop DeMarco Murray, it's that Detroit Defense. Still, Romo + Murray is a damn tall order.  DAL \n CIN vs. CLE: Remember when they used to make fun of this as a toilet bowl? Endless Orange Bowl jokes? This time it looks fantastic. Hoyer is great, but a last second field goal reminds the Browns that they're the Browns.  CIN \n NO vs ARI: Arizona is one of those \"scary\" wild card teams, but the Saints take care of business at home.

Flacco proves to still be ridiculous in the playoffs.  BAL \n \n DIVISIONAL: \n SEA vs DAL: Seattle wanted the Cowboys out of the playoffs. The Boys prove they still have their number after that primetime win.  DAL \n GB vs NO: The QB shootout that makes Joe Buck wet himself. If he can even get that excited.

On the second play, the 3rd & 2 curl, Benjamin ran a gorgeous route, got Peterson's hips turned (if he doesn't do this, Bradley Fletcher-esque things happen on every deep route) and turns around at the perfect moment.", "Well he had a crazy rookie year, and then in the only game we had AD he lit it up. Think of it this way: Take a great safety and make them play corner, and watch them regress. Or even take a slot corner and move them to the outside.

I was 220 in January when I started eating this way. \n It's true, the amount of scale weight I've dropped is actually pretty pithy -- roughly 20lbs since the last time I weighed myself (maybe a week ago). That's 20lbs in over five months. Yeah, that sucks, maybe. But you know what? I don't care. I can fit into all the clothes I've bought comfortably and I think I look just as good in them now at 200lbs compared to 185lbs on keto. \n Maybe it's satisfying to lose 5lbs of scale weight when taking a shit, but is any significant portion of that 5lbs actually fat? I'd imagine the vast majority of it is plant material which didn't get absorbed, not what matters. A lot of why I don't shit as much has to do with how much stuff I have to shit more than any particular digestive/congestion issues. \n Maybe there's something about this way of eating that makes you more arrogant too, because I think I look just as good now at ~200lbs on this diet compared to ~185lbs on VLC.

I find in terms of satiation and hydration, whether it's the fact they have aspartame or the fact they have sodium.. I'm actually  more  hungry after drinking a diet drink than I was before. I can usually abate most cravings for snacks by drinking water, but having a diet coke or coffee the cravings return pretty quickly after the initial \"I put stuff in my mouth, I don't need to eat\" feeling is over. \n I almost would recommend drinking  more  water the more diet sodas you  drink, but when it comes to being hydrated at the very least.. I don't think diet sodas or coffee (can't speak to tea since I don't drink it) are useful to count as water. \n In an ideal world one would  only  drink water, but maybe I'll kick the habit of drinking diet drinks one day. \n Regardless of whether or not you want to \"count\" non-water drinks toward your 8 cups, I don't think it's important or even a good thing to drink a minimum amount of water. \n Drink when you're hungry, when you're thirsty. If you eat something and you still feel \"hungry,\" drink some water (or even better, drink water while you're having your snack/meal). Nearly 100% of the times I've overeaten in the last few weeks has been due to dehydration (and the fact I've started eating out of packages again -_-).. pigging out after work. Drink a half liter of water before you eat more than you think you should -- if you're still hungry in 20 minutes then you're actually hungry and not thirsty. \n I like to have water handy at pretty much all times personally. I usually drink a gallon or more throughout the course of the day when I'm off work and don't have anything to do.

I guess six weeks isn't that far off from a month anyway. \n I've already have had plenty of opportunities to cheat that might have been considered \"excusable.\" My grandfather had a birthday about 2 weeks into me being on keto. We had cake at the house and then he wanted to go get some ice cream from Baskin Robbins. That day was a mild cheat day since I had some meatloaf at the family lunch, which by my best estimates probably had around 20ish grams of carbs for the amount I had. Of course, that was one part of one meal -- I guessed I probably had around 40-50g of carbs that day, when most other days I have more like 11-15g. I passed on the cake and ice cream though, in spite of the fact I was rationalizing in my head \"well, I've already gone way over 20g today.. maybe i should just splurge.\" But I didn't. \n Whenever I go to my family's Sunday lunch it always ends up being more carbs than I normally have, but not, I imagine, how much it would end up being if you had cake and ice cream. I also have heard of people cheating on carbs and feeling pretty shitty afterwards, but I doubt it would kill you as long as you can control how much you have.", "I think it's wrong to imply cravings are purely psychological. There is most definitely a physiological factor at play. I  never  lost my cravings during my 8 months of keto last year, in spite of me trying all these mindfulness techniques. I eventually fell off the keto bandwagon, ate whatever I wanted to for two months (and gained 45lbs in the process). When January rolled around I decided to do something different: eat only meat, which I've been doing since without much issue, except for the occasional assertion that I'm going to die of heart disease because I'm not eating vegetables. \n I found out about a community which is centered around eating only meat; their experience and arguments were pretty persuasive as to why this WOE might be more effective than keto for me. I just didn't know how right they were until I had been on it for a couple months. \n I'm definitely a believer in the idea that having carbs begets the cravings for more carbs, regardless of your mental state. The eventual failure of my keto experience could be boiled down to carb creep. I had some success, I tried different carbs but I didn't really weigh whether or not those carbs were affecting my goals. My fault, of course, but why did I want those carbs in the first place? Some might say boredom or a need for variety, but that's really only half the answer IMO. \n When I went ZeroCarb, the cravings for carbs were gone almost immediately. I might slightly crave something if I'm particularly hungry (like if I should have eaten 3-4 hours ago) and don't have anything appropriate available to eat. I went to a going away party for a friend yesterday and everyone drank beer and ate pizza, except me of course. I couldn't even smell the pizza to be honest, and even went so far as to help the friend who went to go get the pizza (I did smell pizza in the actual pizzeria, where I bemusedly remarked \"smells like pizza in here\"). Of course, I had no cravings because we went next door to get me a whole rotisserie chicken, which I ate most of, thank you very much. I'm at a point now where I can't even imagine eating vegetation, let alone sugar or alcohol.

If anything, NoFap is only the start of a \"journey to manhood,\" although I think basing your \"success\" on something based on gender stereotypes is kinda silly. I think by the time you \"become a man,\" you wouldn't actually  worry  whether or not you were actually a man by anybody's measurement. \n My first instinct when any posts talk about what I should or shouldn't be simply because of my gender is revulsion. While I do agree with the premise that there are some inherent differences between men and women, I do not really like the conclusions you draw from those premises. We work best when we work together, male or female. Men may have \"traditionally\" been the ones who have \"provided\" for the family, but that also doesn't mean that females are unable to fend for themselves if they need to. They aren't helpless. \n If you're going with \"energy exchange,\" how is masturbating not expending energy? I suppose you could extend the analogy to say that we're \"receiving\" energy from porn companies, but even that's stretching a little bit. I suppose you could argue that we're \"wasting\" that energy, but if men expend energy -- then we're still men. Of course, I may sound like I'm rejecting the main premise of this whole subreddit altogether, that PMOing is wasteful and damaging.. I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that. I just don't think your analogy really works in the context of NoFap. \n I'm sure you're trying to be motivational or whatever, but you're just coming off as an asshole. Should we feel guilty because other people have \"more difficult\" lives? Hell, some people have easier lives than us. I'm sure a lot of people have easier lives than us. \n Don't compare yourself, your choices, or how you live your life to anybody else. That's not useful at all. Compare where you are now with where you used to be and adjust accordingly.", "In addition to what MegaStoops suggests, it also sounds like you're looking at NoFap as an end itself, rather than a means to an end. \n If you fapped with any frequency, you probably have  a lot  more free time than you previously did. If you are using this extra time on reddit instead of trying to improve yourself in other areas, you're doing it wrong. Has there been anything you've wanted to do but never felt you had the time? Well, you have the time now. \n I've been doing this for about 3 months or so by this point, and this is by far my longest streak. What helped the most was when I figured out that literally all of my relapses (all 7-8 of them) stemmed from boredom. I basically mindlessly consumed content on the Internet until I had nothing else to consume.. then I would go to the next best thing..

I think I've taken a bit more of an analytic approach to NoFap because at its core I believe what I want from this is to be more in touch with what I'm actually feeling and thinking. It's really surprising when I think about how I really went through my life living on automatic. I felt like I was going toward something, but in reality the only thing I was ever really going toward is the next chance to detach and lose myself on the Internet. \n I tried NoFap for the first time a little over two weeks ago, but I've since relapsed twice.  I'm not particularly disappoint in doing that, and I almost feel as though they were a necessary part of my approach to NoFap. \n You see, my initial start was basically an impulse. I saw Wilson's TED talk, subscribed to the subreddit, and found myself constantly thinking about porn afterward. I didn't make a conscious decision to stop, kept my 200+ gigs of porn on my hard drive, and just thought \"I'll try this out and see what happens.\" About four days later I ultimately succumbed to boredom and fapped before work. I was disappointed in myself and actually thought \"well, I don't have much going on in my life right now and under most circumstances I can't really do anything except school or home because I don't have a car.. maybe I should try this a few months later.\" I think I might have masturbated an hour or two again later. \n But I didn't masturbate again until a few days later. It was again a combination of boredom and testing to see if the mind fog was worth it. I don't think it was until then that I made a real conscious decision to stop fapping. \n That was about a week ago I guess. I barely think about porn at all anymore (except when I'm here) these days and I even took the step to delete my porn collection. And it's odd, over the last few days people seem to react to me better -- or maybe I'm starting to notice how people react to me more successfully now. Heh, one of my co-workers talked about how I never stop smiling yesterday, which is quite a change from two years ago when people said I should smile more.", "The lesson I learnt is that NoFap builds your ego, but when you start feeling better than others and you do NoFap to be better than others you become vulnerable. \n This is silly, sorry if I should insulting. There will always be people better than you, just as there will always people worse than you. Even though I think the suggestion of \"nofap superpowers\" are an exaggeration at best, petty things always work well for initial motivation to try something. Of course, those superpowers don't come just from not fapping, so if you branch out and try other things as a result of not feeling pacified from PMO, I'd say that's a win. \n While I would agree that challenging yourself is more likely to make you happy than comparing yourself to others, I would also argue that using anything external to gauge how happy you \"should\" be is also setting yourself up for not being happy. Happiness ultimately comes from within, and it does't really matter what else is going with your life.

I don't buy into a lot of the metaphysical claims it makes, but I think it's still pretty useful for being a more centered individual. \n Improving yourself is definitely still a must do, but since getting into this stuff, I've realized that improvement shouldn't be a requirement for my contentment. Attempting to improve myself is just something I do because I'm a human being, no more, no less.", "Very much agree with this. I know that submissions such as this are meant to be motivational, but at least for people like me, they miss the point. It's kinda like \"tough love\" people use to motivate others to lose weight, saying things like \"do you want to be a lazy fat ass all of your life? sitting on your ass all day wallowing in your sweaty sorrow?\" Sure, it may be motivating initially -- I know that when my friend who wanted me to lose weight would use similar rhetoric I would definitely say \"Yeah, I don't want to be a fat ass anymore.\" But that kind of motivation doesn't last and it only serves to make you feel worse about yourself when/if you don't make it to your goal. If that happens enough times, you may very well start to feel the struggle isn't worth it. \n In the end, you haven't accomplished anything if all you've done is abstained from masturbating until you deem yourself \"reset.\" Not masturbating is not the important part of the process, even if it is an important first step of the process that is \"the rest of your life.\" \n The better frame of mind for this type of thing is to do anything BUT focus on the fact you're attempting to \"not fap.\" Focus on what you actually want to do. Even though I'm still not convinced of the causal benefits of not fapping, there's plenty of more productive things one could do besides fapping. I think most of the people who have made it to the 90 day mark have realized this, and hell, it's also probably why I've been less than successful at my attempts as well. \n The funny thing is this: when I was the most hardcore into not fapping (~40ish days), when did I think about fapping the most? When I was browsing or posting a message to this subreddit. \n IMO, it also does you no good to make yourself feel like not fapping is a life or death struggle, that somehow you're \"not a man\" if you masturbate. You don't tell me what does or does not make me a man, although I will concede that someone who relies on porn or masturbation to fill some emotional void in their life probably has problems. When you put a heightened emphasis on \"not fapping\" such as OP's submission, you are definitely more likely to think about fapping because of all the pressure about why you shouldn't fap."]}, {"subreddit": "starcraft2_class", "posts": ["I don't think this has been asked yet, but have you picked a race to focus on yet? If so, you definitely want to do that. \n After that, check out the sidebar link to \"Where to start with Day9\" .. he has some  awesome  mechanic/macro guides that help getting started with playing online. One concept he hammers in a lot that I didn't really get an \"ah ha!\" moment from until a couple months ago was the idea of only trying to improve one aspect of your play at a time. There's  A LOT  you can improve upon, but if you say to yourself \"i need to improve my macro\" what does that even mean? That kind of statement is rather vague and honestly a bit overwhelming. \n If you're just starting out, no doubt that you're getting the  very  basic stuff down. At that point, I wouldn't worry too much about playing online unless you really want to. The advantage of playing against the CPU when you're looking at improving your general mechanics is its playstyle is pretty damn predictable. Its Zerg AI will do a relatively early roach rush.. if you're not following a BO properly its Protoss AI will probably end up rushing you with zealots, otherwise expect a relatively early lot/stalker/sentry army with some immortals sprinkled in. \n When you're playing against the CPU, have in mind a certain aspect of your gameplay you want to focus on. Do you want to work on constant worker production? Not getting supply blocked? Getting your build order proper? \n After you finish the game, load up the replay and watch it. If you're looking at worker production, put it at 8x speed and see how constant your production is. Is something distracting you? have you gotten in the habit of tapping your nexus/cc/hatcheries to check on production? \n especially  if you're terran/zerg, tapping is an essential skill to improving the game. Tapping is cycling through your hotkeys to make sure your buildings are ALWAYS doing something. How you hotkey your buildings doesn't really matter as long as you're doing it. Have all your CCs/Nexi/Hatcheries on one hotkey, barracks/gateways on another, etc. This will allow you to have your buildings doing stuff when you have your camera on your scout or with your army. \n Also when you're trying to improve one aspect of your gameplay, only focus on that. This means that if you're trying to improve your macro in general don't use any wonky build order that asks you to move out after 6 minutes. This means something like 3gate expo for protoss, speedling expo for zerg, or 2rax FE for Terran. \n Oh, and I wouldn't worry too much about mid/late game at this point. After you get past your \"comfort\" threshold as far as the length of the game goes, just concentrate on the basics -- keeping production up, keeping your money low, and expand as needed. Once you get to a certain level of comfort, you should be sitting around at least 3-5 bases in a 30-40 minute game, depending on race.", "Definitely watch a lot of the Day9 dailies linked in the sidebar, many of the 'newbie tuesday' oriented dailies are invaluable for learning the game, with 132 and 252 being two of the more important ones IMO. As you get better at the game, he has another video called 'plugging leaks in silver level play' which helped me a lot, but I'm not entirely sure which number that one is. EDIT: Ah it's 121. \n I honestly have to disagree with those who are saying to concentrate on rushing builds until you reach high level. If anything, I would concentrate on macro-oriented builds (being able to build a lot, keeping your money down, etc) at the low level while pretty much all of your opponents are incompetent / passive. It's easier to learn rushes when you have your basic mechanics down rather than spend 6 months getting to Plat/Diamond by doing 7RR and then trying to learn macro. \n I don't know much about zerg in particular (dabble in it but just can't get into a groove w/ them), but with both T and P it's definitely possible to do all three match ups with one general build. I generally go for a semi-early expand style (3gate expo & 2rax expo) because one thing that silver level players are usually not are aggressive, so I'm able to get an early advantage. \n One thing that I still haven't mastered and I would say that is probably the hardest thing to master in general is multitasking. That's, IMO, the problem with focusing on rush builds early on. If the rush fails, you will most likely be hugely behind because your macro will slip hard when you try attacking your opponent. \n In other words, it's kinda sad but my general play style essentially revolves around being passive/defensive and just overwhelming my opponent with a lot of crap when I feel ready to move out with 2 bases worth of units. Unfortunately that's just the most efficient way to play until you get better at tapping and multitasking in general.", "Play. \n I honestly think the only way to get a feel for the game is to well, get a feel for it. I could point you to the \"Where to start with Day9\" link on the side bar and #252 in particular to give you help with general mechanics, but it sounds to me like you don't really even know what you want to do. What race do you want to play? You probably have the most experience with Terran if all you've done is the WoL campaign assuming you have no Brood War experience. \n Have you chosen what race you want to play? Zerg probably has the highest learning curve, Terran is a nice middle ground if you enjoy being aggressive, and Protoss does well with small engagements until they reach a critical \"deathball\" mass. \n I preach to try to learn how to macro (aka concentrating on building a lot of shit and keeping your money low, generally) while you're in the lower brackets. You can probably get relatively high with cheese based strategies (strategies where you sacrifice economy in order to get an early win), but they will quickly become useless. \n Forgetting what I mostly said before this : just immerse yourself in the game and have fun. Don't initially worry too much about \"improving\" or \"playing for serious\" until you've gotten your feet wet. This game is impossible to master and very hard to get much beyond bronze level (mostly assuming you have little to no RTS experience in general), so don't worry if you don't play like Nestea right out of the box. When you have a better idea of where you want to go in the game and a better idea of what you need improvements on, you can ask us more specific questions. \n Oh, and about improvement in particular, only concentrate on one particular aspect of your game play at a time, and make sure your goal isn't too vague. In other words, don't tell yourself you want to \"improve your macro.\" You may very well need to improve your macro, but it doesn't really help focus you when your goal is something as vague as macro. What aspect of your macro needs improving? Are you getting supply blocked, not following your build order properly, not constantly making workers? Make sure when you tell yourself of something you want to improve, you're clear and specific on what you want to improve. \n As far as build orders go, I eventually settled on just doing 1 build for all my match ups when I was working on getting out of bronze. I was Protoss so that build was a 3gate sentry expand. Similar builds might be 2rax expand for Terran and speedling expand for zerg. You can look these builds up on [liquipedia]( but I wouldn't worry too much about what build you're sticking with until you get better acclimated in the game itself.", "I have mixed feelings about this. \n Above all, I suppose you're right, until we're looking at probably Diamond or Master level replays, most of our replies are going to boil down to macro better. At the same time, I think it's better to post a replay regardless because for some who are just starting to concentrate on trying to improve, some things won't be as obvious to them as someone who's actually watched their replays. They may not even know how to \"improve macro,\" since what a person has to do in order to improve macro will vary and is pretty vague if you just set your goal as \"macro better.\" \n I've seen a number of posts where the OP either didn't know how to post a replay or didn't think it was necessary to post one, but they ask something like \"How do I defend against X or Y when I have A and B?\" They look at the final engagement and think that it was at that point they lost, where they probably lost much earlier in the game. \n I actually responded to a submission that kind of fits the bill. He said he had no clue how he won and wanted to know how he could apply what he did in order to win more. My first sentence, after I watched the reply on 4-8x speed, was that it wasn't so much that he won, but that his opponent lost. I also told him that looking at replays looking for ways to win isn't quite as important as looking at replays for ways to avoid losing. The next post after that, I made a laundry list \n True, I've made quite similar posts to that one before and I'm sure it won't be the last time I make a post in a similar vein. The problems that a lot of the players I reply to could quite easily be fixed by reading the sidebar and watching some of the Day9 newbie tuesday videos. Of course, I don't hold it against them that much -- there's quite a bit of information on even just the sidebar and it's understandably intimidating to be able to tell where to actually start. \n But you're right, I don't think it's hugely useful to look at the wins unless you're looking for ways to improve mechanically. Those kinds of replays don't really need us. At the same time, it's pretty easy to get lost in the big picture when it's usually small things at the beginning that cause low league players to have trouble, so that's another reason why I don't mind looking at bronze/silver league replays even though I know it's going to boil down to banking too much money and general inefficiencies in game play.", "With season 3, I was able to finally get promoted from Silver to Gold. I've won 3 of my 4 games.  I barely played at all in S2, but for some reason I'm getting the fire under my butt again as far as playing this game goes. \n The game I lost was a PvP and I essentially just lost focus and when I skimmed the replay it looks like my opponent just kept his money down much better than I did. It was ~23 minutes and not long before the final engagement I noticed I was hovering around 2k/1k whereas the opponent was hovering around 600/500. Of course, neither of those are anything to be satisfied with, but given the fact we were both at 3 or 4 bases by that time it shouldn't be very surprising. :P But the fact he seemed to take his expansions shortly before me and he was keeping his money down better just owned me. \n I can post that replay if you think it'll help, but it didn't seem very representative of the way I actually play and I think my macro was the biggest weakness I had in that game compared to my opponent. \n Ultimately, I think my early game is relatively solid.. I'm not turtling (as much) anymore, at least poking at their base when I'm set to expand (probably @ ~6-7mins) to give myself a better idea of what he may be doing. I essentially open with a 3gate sentry expand, but after that I kind of wing it although the games I've won have been some variant of a double forge gateway heavy build. \n I think my biggest weakness right now is as my second gets really saturated and I'm vying to take my third, I'm not really sure what to do. If you look at the PvP I posted it's like I was trying to do 6 different tech paths at once (went heavy on the zealots, but didn't research charge until late in the game, made a robo and a bay but only like 3 colossus, made an archive but only a few templars and I don't think I used storm until he was in my base, I also should have made  many  more Immortals with how many Stalkers he had) and in general I feel that, especially toward the end of the game, I was playing very sloppily. \n I know, in general, you're supposed to have a game plan, but unfortunately my game plan only goes about 10-12 minutes into the game. What's a good way to be prepared for late game? I also know spent money is better than banked money, but it seems a bit.. mm, wrong, to make 12 gateways that I probably can't support beyond a single warpin. \n Replays: \n [PvT - Win Example]( \n [PvP - Loss Example]("]}, {"subreddit": "atheism", "posts": ["I agree that babies are born atheists, and in a sense you are right that atheism might not always be technically a response position. \n At the same time, though, if nobody believed in God, then there would be no term for atheist because, I mean, just look at the etymology. a theist -- without belief in a god. I kinda said it already, but the argument \"works\" because the word \"atheist\" wouldn't exist if nobody believed in a God. Atheists only exist because theists exist. \n You got me thinking for a minute though. Humans have evolved to observe natural occurrences and see agency in them. At our most basic instinct, we see a bush moving about because of the wind and we worry about a predator being behind that bush. It's only through learning and evidence based reasoning (e.g. I may have  thought  there was a predator behind that bush, but I've never actually  seen  a predator behind that bush, so maybe I don't need to worry about htat in most situations) that we can really start to see the differences between natural occurrences and things which happen based on the intervention on other creatures. \n I suppose the difference between the agency that a kid may see in nature and an actual theistic dogma is that if a kid grows up with naturalistic parents, they're more likely to teach that kid about how things happen naturally. Whereas the theistic parents are more likely to reinforce that false positive nature that the kid probably grew up with. No doubt this is why childhood indoctrination works so well, in addition to the respect to authority young children have anyway. \n With that stuff in mind, it might actually be more technically correct to say a human baby is born with a likelihood to believe in an intervening force in the world, in other words -- one CAN argue that based on evolutionary traits, a baby is theistic until they're old enough to learn more about the natural world. The main difference between a baby theist and grown up theist is the dogma that the grown up theist uses to reinforce their belief. \n At the same time, I guess we can't really know what's going through a baby's mind until they've learned to talk, so might be \"safer\" to look at them as atheist just because they aren't necessarily theistic.", "Is the definition like you say? Wikipedia claims that it's a rejection of the belief in deities or a claim outright that there are none. I don't trust wikipedia that much - but neither of these definitions seem to apply to a baby, dog, or lamp. \n I haven't thought about this  too  deeply, but I'm of the opinion that it doesn't really  matter  whether any of those things believe in a God or if it's \"fair\" to call them atheists. In a way, you could actually argue that, in a sense, babies might think of themselves as gods, in terms of being the cause for everything around them. It isn't until around 5 or so that infants develop what they call a \"theory of mind,\" which is the ability to see the difference between \"you\" and other people.. to see that you aren't the only actor which affects the things around \"you.\" \n Until this time, they literally believe they are the cause of everything around them. This is the reason why things that happens to kids around this age may affect the baby pretty drastically as they grow up. If the child feels abandoned or smothered around this time, they will feel that it's they're fault they are abandoned or smothered will affect how they deal with things later in life. If you've ever heard of the \"Nice Guy Syndrome,\" its validity hinges on those premises. \n Babies don't have thoughts? No doubt they're much more simple than the thoughts that go through our head I'm sure, but it has a working brain. Not fully developed by any means, but it's probably not fair to say it doesn't have thoughts. \n But that's kind of beyond the point, I believe that the most important \"thing\" to discuss when it comes to religion are 1) whether or not one believes, 2) why they've come to that conclusion, and possibly 3) how their belief in god affects their view of reality. \n It's for those reasons that I do not picture myself having a religious discussion with a lamp. If I do, that's probably some mighty fine peyote. \n This is probably the \"definition\" of atheism that I like the best (except for the \"doctrine\" part): \n atheism:\n  n 1: the doctrine or belief that there is no God [syn:\n       atheism, godlessness] [ant: theism]\n  2: a lack of belief in the existence of God or gods\n \n Just look at the construction of the word \"atheism\" -- theism with the prefix \"a-\" which basically means without: \"without theism.\" \n In other words,  why  one doesn't believe in god doesn't have as much affect on whether or not I'd slap the \"atheist\" label on them as much as whether or not they believe in god. If they don't believe in god, they're an atheist until they accept jesus christ as their lord and savior. You can be an atheist and still be a buddhist, for example -- they don't believe in a deity. Atheism doesn't have any positive attached to it -- it only describes that you don't believe in god.. not how you've come to that position or what you actually believe in. \n One can be irreligious and still not be an atheist. All of those people who believe in god but don't go to church aren't atheists -- they're still Christians. My mother has been catholic most of her life but there was a ~20 year span when she didn't go to church while I was growing up. She was Catholic even when she didn't go to church. \n You also seem to be getting hung up on the difference between \"being an atheist\" and \"being a theist.\" There's no real specific point for everyone when they say to themselves, \"yeah, I'm an atheist,\" whereas there's probably a specific point for most religions where they'd say they're a Christian. There's a lot of ritual involved in religions, not so in atheism. Yet. ;) \n The minute you stop believing in god is when I would call you an atheist. You can still go to church -- hell you can be a frikken  preacher  and still be an atheist. There was an episode of TheThinkingAtheist's podcast that touched on that actual subject: preachers who lost their faith but continued preaching because they didn't know what to do. Of course, I'm sure most people who've spent most of their lives believing in god will be met with a lot of internal resistance when they actually start trying to decide for themselves whether the claims made by their religion are true. There will be a lot of attempts to reconcile the evidence with the emotional connection they feel with their god. The minute they let go of that resistance is probably the moment I would consider that former theist an atheist. \n It's because the deconversion experience is very personal I don't think it's really that fair to nitpick on when specifically one should be called an atheist. It's just as well to ask if they believe in a God -- if their answer is anything other than some variation of \"yes,\" they're an atheist.", "Maybe I should preface this post by saying that I have no formal training in philosophy or logic so if I make any glaring errors in either one of those regards, feel free to rip it up. \n > Any set of assumptions that are non-contradictory cannot be elevated or regarded as \"better\" than another, objectively. \n Hm.. on its face, I suppose there's no objectiv reason why one axiom is better than the other except for perhaps that axiom's predictive value. An axiom doesn't really have predictive value in a vacuum of course, but science ostensibly relies on the accuracy of subjective senses/monitors on the objective reality of our universe. The fact we've been able to develop many models with a very high degree of accurate predictability seems to give a lot of credibility to that axiom. \n Of course, that doesn't change the fact theists take much more on faith than atheists, meaning from a purely \"objective\" standpoint, assuming there's no God until we find evidence to the contrary seems to be the most pragmatic position to take. \n Why do I say theists take more on faith? \n Theists  also  take on faith what atheists take on faith on their most basic level at least to a certain extent. I know in certain circumstances theists believe what they see doesn't necessarily match up to objective reality, but in mundane, daily life -- theists believe what they see is what is there. \n The fact that just from a numerable list of axioms, theists have more. It would lead me to believe that even if an assumption that God exists isn't \"objectively\" \"worse\" than what axioms atheists use.. the fact that theists also use the same axioms that atheists use leads me to believe that atheists rely less on faith than theists do.", "While I don't disagree with the sentiment of your graphic, I think you miss the \"point\" of this subreddit judging by the title. What does it even matter what you are? If you call yourself an agnostic, that really means, to me, that you don't even want to have a conversation about what you actually believe, since agnosticism doesn't even tell me what you believe. \n And FWIW, I'm also agnostic, but I'm also an atheist. \n For some, this is one of the very few outlets (maybe closeted, maybe not)  some atheists have. True, it may not be \"useful\" for the \"spreading\" of atheism to post facebook status updates and rage comics painting religious people in a bad light, but that's not the point of those things. People have been complaining a lot lately (more than usual, it seems) about this subreddit being a circlejerk and well, OF COURSE IT IS! It's a subreddit for atheists by atheists about atheism. I'm just somewhat happy there's not more circlejerking than there already is. \n And beyond that, we are not \"Reddit Atheists.\" To even say \"I'm an atheist\" the same way someone would \"I'm a Christian\" doesn't really have any descriptive power. We're people and we all react differently to theists. While I post here I'm having a discussion with a guy who's confused about what he should call himself even though he's been raised as a Christian, because some of what he believes of the world might not easily line up with what he's been taught theologically. If I acted as you said, I probably should have called him an idiot four or five times by now. \n So,", "Reddit in general has a huge issue with confirmation bias \n It works both ways. You don't think people bring up these issues because you don't really make note of them when people do. I, on the other hand, have confirmation bias on the other end -- I notice it A LOT when people complain about this subreddit being a circlejerk. At the same time, I mentioned to you already my theory on why this subreddit appears to be a circlejerk (heck, at some level, the  concept  of subreddits are circljerks in themselves) so I won't go into that. ;p \n Whether people bring it up, I think all of us are aware at some level that most people here are at least well enough off to have Internet and somewhat technically savvy. The majority of people here are more likely than not guys and I'd almost wager that the majority of people on reddit in general are at least VERY moderate in their religious beliefs if not flat out atheist. \n Yes, this place does seem to encourage a hivemind like environment, the upvote/downvote system all but enforces that even though people are not supposed to use those as a content filter. As I mentioned though, it does work both ways. People talk as if their opinion is the only one that matters, and at the same time when people complain about things.. they also complain as if they're complaining about a hivemind. You talk about this subreddit as if all of us are guilty about what you're complaining about. \n Fact of the matter is, even if the majority of r/atheism appears to be volatile toward people who believe in god, we probably are not. Let me tell you right now, I hate religion. I hate what it does to people. I hate the fact people believe in things for which they have no proof. Ever hear the saying, love the sinner, hate the sin? I do that, if religion were the sin in the analogy. I believe that the majority of people here who attack religion are not attacking the adherents themselves, but the religion which they represent and symbolize. There are probably some who transition from hating the religion to hating the adherent, but let me tell you, I don't. \n And I guess that sucks about having to log in each time, do you use a multi-user computer or something? I can't use reddit without being logged in because of all the niche subreddits I spend most of my time in.

It sounds like you're already assuming failure before you even start. Saying stuff like \"the harder you try, the faster you sink\" and comparing yourself to other people is a no-no. Especially comparing yourself to girls. Guys are traditionally the ones who have to do the approaching, so I'd be surprised if you were going out on more dates than your female counterparts even if you were \"good\" at cold approaching. \n There are actually a couple cliches that make sense when it comes to dating/social interactions -- the first one is \"the real you comes shining through.\" This is actually most of the reason why you're immediately getting blown out when you \"try harder;\" a woman doesn't want a guy who has to \"try hard\" to impress her. She wants a guy who doesn't try to impress her but does anyway through his actions and his confidence. \n You're already losing out by being attached to the outcome -- you feel as though you're a failure if you don't get the number or have a good interaction. Let me let you in on a secret -- no matter how \"good\" you get at interacting with people, it's still a numbers game to some extent. You may approach ten girls and only get one to acknowledge you. You may may approach 20 and only get 2 numbers. The more you do this kind of stuff, though, the less you are attached to the outcome of that specific approach, and then you start tapping into the real powerful stuff -- you start trying to have fun instead of thinking in the back of your head \"have to get her number, have to get her number.\" Once you can be present to the moment and not worry about the outcome, I imagine you will be much more successful. Worry less about whether you get a specific outcome from the encounter, do NOT worry AT ALL about whether or not the girl likes you, and congratulate yourself on what you HAVE done. Celebrate the little victories where ever you can and eventually those little victories will build up to a big victory in some way. \n The second cliche that actually makes sense once you frame it properly is \"you find the perfect girl when you stop looking for her.\" Usually it's framed in a sense of \"stop looking for a relationship\" type thing, but especially as a guy, if you stop looking for relationships in general, you won't find one. But it's very possible to be in relationships without being hung up on finding \"the one.\" This is why most pick up advice suggests that in order to get that specific girl you're looking for, you first need to be able to get any girl. \n And IMO, \"casual dating\" is the default mode when you're past high school as far as I'm concerned. Casual dating is just a date. You aren't committing to that girl in terms of being on a express path to marriage; she has to prove herself to you that she's worth committing to. Now I don't necessarily mean playing \"hard to get\" as a strategy (although I'm a very big proponent of not being attached to the outcome of whatever you're doing, so you should come off as harder to get than most guys once you aren't attached), but the idea behind dating someone is to get to know them to see whether you guys \"click.\" I wouldn't be so worried about leading her on; if after one date you know there's no possibility for something being in store.. if you don't have fun with her in that way, then stop going out with her. If you aren't interested in her, she's not worth going out with. If you think you you might like to be friends with her, then go that route -- it's never a bad thing to expand your social circle. \n I wouldn't even bother approaching/going out with somebody you're not interested in. The idea is to get yourself to a point that you aren't so desperate for female intimacy that you'll lower your standards, but that you're confident enough in yourself to realize that people you aren't attracted to aren't worth your time to potentially date. If that means you're single for a while, that shouldn't be a problem. In fact, I would recommend not committing to any one person for a while and just concentrate on being more social in general. It sounds like you're somewhat of a homebody (hey, I am too), and IMO, a lot of success with dating comes from not being attached to whether or not your partner likes you. One guy describes as a balance between having the confidence to be vulnerable combined with the freedom from outcome so that vulnerability isn't coming from a needy place. A relationship is not something that should make you \"whole.\" It's just a nice perk, so to speak. It's an important perk, but it should NOT be something so integral to your identity that your world crumbles around you if it doesn't work out. \n Whether you realize it or not, a lot of the stuff is similar to the stuff from /r/seduction and pick up in general. It seems to have a pretty bad rap at least in this thread, but I think that comes from a knee jerk reaction to the idea of getting coached on picking up women. But like anything else, pick up is not about presenting a fake you, but the best you. I mean, you have the option of wearing a nice suit or your pajamas, and I'd imagine the suit is going to get you laid before the pajamas will; is this presenting a \"fake you?\" It's much the same with pickup, and I'm convinced the REAL thing that pick up fixes for people who spend a lot of time on the Internet is it gives them one less excuse to not approach that girl they find attractive. Even with all the material in the world, you aren't going to get anybody to like you with an attitude like yours and a lot of practice. As I mentioned earlier -- \"the real you shines through\" regardless of the material you use. I'd recommend at least giving the seddit faq a once over, especially the \"inner game\" portions, as that seems like the biggest road block for you at the moment.", "The only real \"experience\" I have with getting old even semi-directly is my grandfather who is in his mid-80s and has pretty much given up on life.. getting old and becoming like him is the only thing I fear, but because I see the external indicators of why he is like he is -- I can avoid it while I still have the will to do it. He's never really taken care of himself; he got married early (like 16) and his wife took care of him for most of his life, so he had no clue what to do when she died around 10 years ago, so it was up to his daughters to take care of him. He's also never appreciative of what they do, acting almost as if it should be expected of them to take care of him. He also says stuff like \"all I want to do is see your mother in heaven\" to them.. \n I seem to have been dealt a pretty decent genetic advantage (never any serious medical issues, never developed symptoms of diabetes in spite eating <400 grams of carbs a day until recently, and my parents are really healthy for being in their 60s) and have been pretty healthy in spite of the fact I haven't really cared at all about my health until the last year or two. I hit 30 back in January and I seem to have experienced somewhat of a paradigm shift; I got really interested in losing weight, getting active and eventually got interested in health in general. If I have anything to say about that, I  will  be someone who ages gracefully, barring any weird accidents that kill me instantly. \n In my teens and twenties I seemed to have an obsession about material things -- only being interested in money and what I could do with it. Unfortunately I never had the ambition to actually do anything specifically to get it, I made some stupid choices and had my priorities all out of whack for the vast majority of my life. It sounds cheesy to say, but I really feel as though the first ~28 years of my life were effectively a waste, even though it really wasn't. I know I would not be the same person today if, so it's disingenuous for me to say it's a waste, but the things I considered important even three years ago are no longer what I believe are important. \n I eventually realized that happiness is more of a state of mind rather than something based on external success, so while I may not be making much money at all.. don't even have a car.. work at Wal-Mart.. don't have a huge amount of friends (or even any close ones to be honest).. I'm more happy with my life than I have ever been before.

I guess I was bored enough [to find it]( \n I suppose I never really specifically made my own post in response to the link itself, but the general sentiment of my comments were is that, by itself, a phrase like \"man up\" is pretty pointless. When it comes to \"OneY\" specifically, it's really kind of insulting, but if constructive criticism is followed by its use.. I suppose I would ignore the fact that the phrase is pretty useless in my opinion. I honestly don't think there are characteristics that makes a \"good\" person that are gender specific.. so the call toward gender stereotypes in hopes of trying to \"help someone\" is counterproductive in my opinion. \n I don't really consider myself the \"manliest\" man around, but I guess that's the thing -- as much as it may make things easier to \"man up\" and act like an asshole when it calls for it.. well, it's not something I want to do. \n This was my most general response to the phrase in that previous submission: \n> Depends on the context. I'm all for constructive criticism instead of using buzzwords.\nIf someone thinks I need to change somehow, tell me how. Don't tell me how I need to \"man up\" or \"toughen up.\" Neither of those are useful. \n Tell me why or how I need to toughen up.  THAT'S  the useful part of an \"intervention\" of that sort.. the simple stating that someone needs to be \"more of a man\" is useless and vague.", "While these ideas of masculinity aren't necessarily false, it's sentiments such as these which have created such high expectations in what a \"man\" should be able to do on his own that he's inherently afraid to ask for help. It's this fear of rejection for showing vulnerability, he's more likely to commit suicide than a woman of a similar age once puberty is reached. \n No doubt, all of these quotes are very lofty, illustrating an ideal than necessarily expressing reality. At some level, this is definitely true and I don't really believe anything that's worth fighting for is something that will come easily to whoever wants it. But all of these quotes imply the value of a man is only found in the external factors in his life -- his conquests, his material possessions, and the like. This is untrue, and ultimately is probably one of the most damaging aspects of social conditioning's definition of masculinity. Every once in a while you will hear someone suggest that a man should be willing to ask for help, but by far it's drowned out by the sentiment suggested in these quotes, that a man is not necessarily a man unless he's effectively the rock which cannot be moved in the storm. \n I would consider myself a feminist in a vague sense, but I think a similar movement is needed for men (masculism?). Similar in function but very different in goals. I'm not suggesting that the system is structurally biased toward women to the extent which is was biased against them except in some specific circumstances, such as custody issues and jail sentences for violent crimes. I think it's absurd that a guy who might be more in touch with his emotions than your \"Average Joe\" is likely to be ridiculed for being gay. It's absurd that men are 3/4th's more likely to commit suicide than women. It's absurd that, even though women fought for the right to be part of the workforce, men are not respected for choosing to take care of their children if they chose to do that. \n What men need is an emotional rebirth. Men are not disposable, and we need to get past the mindset that a man is only as valuable as what he can produce, procure, or fight for. I definitely agree with the top (right now?) comment that these attributes are not exclusive to men nor should they be, and I think it's these sentiments which make most men have the emotional maturity of a five year old. Men not only need to cultivate skills which will help them in the \"real world,\" they also need to cultivate skills which will help in their \"internal world,\" aka their emotional stability.", "Yes, fuck society and what box they want to put you in. \n Of course, it's definitely very important to in touch with your emotions, but I also think it's important to not be controlled by your emotions. Emotions very well might be a human experience, but you are also not your emotions. They only define you if you let them, and I don't believe you should allow them to define you. \n Hear me out -- I'm not suggesting that you ignore or repress your emotions, but at the same time, all emotions are just, in a practical sense, a physical manifestation of thoughts. And honestly, the mind is an amazing piece of biological machinery, but just as you are not simply your emotions, you are also not simply your mind. If you read anything based on eastern philosophy, (meditation related stuff, Eckart Tolle, etc) they'll espouse similar things. \n Take a recent example of my own. I'm starting to think I have weird control/authority issues, and when people question my authority on something, or question how I work.. I get really neurotic and/or whiny. Last week I was an acting manager of the department I work in, and it had been quite a while since I had worked in that department in the first place. I was kind of lost in terms of what I was supposed to do, and I suppose it showed in my work. I kinda said some offhand sarcastic comments that it didn't matter how hard I worked.. and one of my coworkers apparently relayed that to my boss. She pulled me to the side and asked if she should assume, based on that comment, that I don't care about my job anymore. I actually started to act as if I was going to cry. Didn't quite cry because of something else that happened that cut the conversation short, but you know. \n A fear of rejection, a suggestion that I wasn't doing my job. That's what caused that reaction. That's the only fact that matters as far as I'm concerned, not the actual fact that I wanted to cry. I mean, I already know I have a pretty horrible fear of rejection, but I suppose it just drives the point home. \n If you watch something and you feel sad because of it, go ahead and cry. I believe that anybody worth spending time with or watching a movie with would not judge you negatively because you reacted \"appropriately\" to a tear jerker movie. At the same time, if you enjoy hanging out with \"bros\" who are likely to react negatively to someone crying at a movie, there you go. As much as you don't want to be put into a box by society, you also cannot put individuals that make up society into your own box. There are people who think similarly to you, and ultimately, if you want to be around people who are okay with you showing emotion, then you will have to find them. Some would suggest that part of being a man is going after what you want, whether it's a girl friend or like-minded friends. \n If you find yourself attracted to someone, make your intentions known. If the girl doesn't appreciate your advances, either something about your approach was \"wrong\" or she just didn't like you. No skin off anyone's back as far as I'm concerned. I think it's important to not look at dating as a means to an end, but an end in itself. Enjoy meeting people, meeting girls and see how they tick.. rather than necessary using women to fill some kind of weird need for intimacy. Granted, I understand the desire to be close to someone, but it doesn't happen just because you want it. \n And hell, I don't think the Ted Mosby style of dating ever actually works in the real world. Ted Mosby is a needy bitch (as much as I like HIMYM), and speaking honestly, I would not want a female version of Ted Mosby. Ted Mosby is identified by his \"need\" for love.. that neediness is what drives people away. Good for him that it presumably works out in the end for him, but this ain't Hollywood. \n Honestly, I think it's romcoms and shows like HIMYM that fuck men up, rather than society necessarily being \"afraid\" of men's emotions, although I don't deny that's an issue as well."]}, {"subreddit": "AskReddit", "posts": ["I'm 29 and male, will be 30 in about 6 months. \n The reason I'm a virgin stems from the fact, I suppose, that I've never been in that kind of relationship.

Don't get me wrong, I'd interact with females, but anyone who was even slightly attractive I'd treat them like they were on a pedestal and hell, while I was in high school I don't think I even thought much of trying to date girls, let alone attempting to do something about it. IIRC, I was a senior by the time I actually started noticing girls in that way, maybe junior. I was a total recluse during my school years.. some people may have talked to me, but with the exception of a guy in my neighborhood who I met in elementary, I didn't have any friends. I wasn't picked on that much (I'm guessing cuz while I was a geek I was also a big guy).. most people just ignored me and I ignored them. \n Fast forward through my 20s, I'm working at various retail places and living with a guy who I was friends with (one of two people who I'd deem a \"close friend,\" the other eventually committed suicide) felt that he wanted to be a mentor to me. He felt I had potential and I was squandering it. He tried to do things in order to motivate me and each time I disappointed him he got a little more annoyed with me. Eventually things devolved into him trying to beat sense into me. Yes, literally. \n I guess as the \"best time of my life\" rushed past me I convinced myself that nobody, romantically or not, would want to give me the time of day. Most of the people I knew were either from work or people I knew through that friend, so while he pissed me the hell off a lot of times.. we spent way too much time together. I would eventually run away one morning after I gather my belongings that I could put in my car and go to my parents where I've stayed until I moved out about a year ago (still in the same town as them though). \n Most of my interests seem to diverge quite greatly from people around or below my age. I wouldn't even say that \"I like talking about things of substance and others don't,\" but it's hard for me to get engaged in a conversation when the subject matter isn't something I'm interested in. One of the few females (quite a bit older than me) who I've gotten semi-close to at work calls me weird/different.. true, she uses it in an endearing way, but I dunno, she comments on how I seem to like to dive deep into a subject when I join the conversation. I guess I'm just not good at the shallow, small talk. That may also weird some people out, I don't know. \n Oh, and I also ramble when given the chance.", "For weight loss, exercising is actually a bit detrimental to that end. Don't get me wrong, exercising is incredibly important, but for purposes of weight loss.. diet is key. Are you a vegetarian for moral or health reasons? If for health reasons, animal flesh isn't bad for you. Conventional wisdom about health is mired with misinformation. I would actually try to cut out your carbohydrates some in order to lose weight, specifically the pizza and donuts.. but I'd have to know what other foods you have to see what you can cut out. You say you track your food with MFP -- how many calories are you eating a day and what are your macronutrient ratios? \n For measuring progress specifically, when you get to a certain point, it may be more useful to track other things than weight. Your measurements might be getting smaller. You may be able to lift more than you were before. \n When you exercise, what kind of exercise? Cardio or weight lifting? For the purposes of aesthetics, it seems like weight lifting might be more useful. Cardio is definitely important though, I can tell the difference between night and day when it's been a couple months since I've been running in terms of how long it takes me to get winded. \n > There is no one to help, either I pull myself out of the hole, or I don't. Has anyone been in this position, and made a life change? How did you do it? \n I've lost 75lbs over the last eight months \"on my own.\" Of course, there are even more fundamental ways I'd probably want to change myself if I could, but I'm sure that counts for something. In fact, it was because I wanted to do this on my own is that I was actually successful. I had people giving me \"encouragement\" and \"advice\" (sometimes contradictory advice) throughout my whole life telling me how to lose weight and it wasn't until people got out of my face about it that I was actually able to do something about it. \n Of course, it wasn't completely on my own but also thanks to the people who post on  /r/keto  and  /r/loseit  for both information and inspiration. \n As far as social things.. I'm not very social either, but I honestly think in order to get more social, you have to be more social. Talk to people. See somebody at the supermarket getting your favorite brand of chips? Talk to em. See somebody at the book store reading a book by your favorite philosopher? Talk to em. And most importantly, listen to them when they talk. And as far as \"being interesting,\" I think you may be looking at it wrong. Sure, you can travel the world and see the world, and if that's something that's interesting to you, go for it, but don't do that just so you can pick up girls. What  I  think is more important to having people \"think you are interesting\" are these: \n \n People are a lot more interested to talk about themselves than to listen to someone go on a monologue. When you talk to someone, listen to what they say and pick up key words and try to relate to them with something they specifically say. Ask open ended questions about what they're talking about to find out more about what they're talking about. In general, you will find people will be more engaged with you and you will have to do \"less work\" in order for them to be interested in the conversation (and therefore interested in you). \n I think the  way  you say something is much more important than what you say when it comes to whether or not someone is interested in what you say. I have an issue with essentially speaking in monotones when I talk, so people get disinterested very easily. I'm also \"laid back\" to a fault.. I don't really react to anything. If I showed excitement more easily I'm sure people would well, be more excited around me. I suppose another problem I have is rambling. ;) \n People are empathetic, so they will tend to feel what you feel. It may be useful to think about the way you want yourself to feel when talking to someone if you start to get nervous \n \n In general, if you're anything like me, you have to force yourself not to be stuck in your own mind and be cognizant of the people around you. Every minute you aren't in your house is an opportunity for social interaction. I should probably stop listening to music when I go shopping for example. You have to make an effort to put yourself out there, and while I have no doubt you will feel awkward as shit while doing this for quite a while.. I think that's the only real way to stop the awkwardness when it comes to social things. \n As far as a genuine relationship?.. I read a dating book a few years ago (only a chapter or two, I suck at reading) and the only thing I remember from it was a nugget of advice that said not to worry about getting into a relationship with someone until you're at a point in your life where you won't need that other person for happiness. I agree with that myself. I would continue to work on myself until I brought another person into my life in that capacity. Be happy on your own before you worry about whether or not you're happy with someone else.", "There's a difference between hating religion and hating a follower of the religion. \n And I do hate the very concept of religion. It puts power into mortals with a supposed god behind that power which we have  ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF  that no such a god exists. This most certainly leads to abuse and corruption. Not in every case, but the foundation of every religion is based on a premise that is not falsifiable. I try to look at things with an air of skepticism (in other words, don't accept it as true until evidence is given) which inevitably leads me to not believing in the various pantheon of gods that are in front of me. \n Yet people talk about their given god with the certainty that would lead me to believe they have actual proof. But they have no proof beyond what amounts to voices in their head, emotional experiences, and \"miracles\" that had just as much chance of happening without a god. It kind of irritates me if I can be completely honest, but beyond that annoyance, I have no issue with most religious people that I interact with. \n If I couldn't get along with religious people, I'd have a  hell  of a time at work since nearly 100% of the people I work with are religious. Fact of the matter is, religion is not a factor in their out-of-church lives even if they claim to be x,y religion. I don't hate religious people -- I may cringe or smirk if I'm over for dinner with someone and they want me to pray before eating, but I'll let them have their prayer before eating. I'm a guest afterall. \n I honestly could not care less about what people believe, unless it affects other people who don't share the same faith. While I'm not homosexual, I'm definitely a proponent of equal protection under the law for whatever orientation wants to get married. I also don't like how the only reason stem cell research is/was being stifled for only religious reasons. There are a great many of ways that progress is impeded by the church at large and I'm sure you wouldn't disagree with that. \n I doubt you're going to answer this if you even see this, but how do you reconcile evolution and the big bang with creation? And if you'll answer the first question, this is the one I'm more interested in being answered: how do you decide what in the bible is allegorical/metaphorical and what's real? \n But I plead with you that you don't read my animosity toward religion in general as animosity toward you. I don't know you from a bump in the road, but judging by your opening post, you seem quite a moderate christian. I'm fine with that. If picking and choosing the claims to reality which your bible makes that you want to believe while still believing the main premise about God helps you get through the day, more power to you. It doesn't help me, but it also doesn't make me think less of you in other areas assuming you apply more rationality toward those areas than your religious convictions. \n Wow. I sound mad. Maybe I should go to bed. Haha, I promise, I'm not. I'm just pissed at my losing streak in SC2 I think. -_- \n In the end, just like you can't glomp all Christians under one blanket identity, neither can you do the same with redditors. There are definitely a vocal minority who harass and make fun of Christians (especially in /r/atheism), but I'm relatively sure it's a minority, not a majority. Only diff is you remember the harassment and forget posts like these where I at least attempt to treat you with some civility, even if I may not have totally succeeded in that venture.", "I guess I qualify as \"older\" since I just turned 30 and 15-16 was quite a while for me. \n \n In general, \"try harder\" \n Take school more seriously -- I basically graduated high school as a straight C student, took a year off, started working at BBV, went to a tech school because I didn't want to even try to go to a university, and never even finished. \n Worry more about \"superficial\" things like social connections and general health. I wasn't morbidly obese through high school because my parents fed me (relatively) healthy food, but I didn't really know the value of well, not eating fast food every day. I don't care about being in the popular crowd, but the fact I never had any friends in high school.. well, sucks. Basically came home and went back to playing video games. \n While I was in the middle of going to tech school, my parents decided to move to Mississippi (I was in GA at the time). I didn't really have the option of a dorm. I also didn't make enough money where I worked in order to get an apartment relatively local to me, so I moved an hour away with my friend. I wasn't really ready to try to make it \"on my own\" at the time, so I wish I had moved with my parents and at least finished school. \n Regulate the amount of video games I played. This is probably why I was so disinterested in everything else. I played video games waaaay to damn much. \n I wish I cared a bit more for actual friendship back then. Most of the \"close\" friends I've had during my middle/high school years I came to hate slightly because of the fact they made me feel like shit more than not. Granted, I was probably not the easiest kid to be around, but I guess that's my own thing. I made friends with a handful of kids in my neighborhood, but I've always had issues with making lasting friendships. \n \n My life isn't horrible now, but I'm making basically the same amount of money now than I was when I worked for Blockbuster (10 years ago). I have enough money to live on, pay my rent, and can afford to go out every once in a while. In addition to that, I also started fixing my weight problem that I've had nearly all my life. Better late than never I suppose. \n I dunno, I guess the biggest thing is that I wasn't interested in trying new things back when I was in school and I think I've suffered for it. I'm still a bit hesitant to  try  new things these days, but I like reading and hearing about things I don't know about.. so there's that. I know my parents at least prodded me a bit to be more outgoing and not play videogames all the time, but even if I humored them, it was just to humor them, not because I was genuinely interested in trying.", "I don't know that I would really say I have any \"close\" friends since I've moved here, but the closest friend I have started talking to me because I told another co-worker that I don't care about having Sunday off because I didn't believe in God. He overheard the conversation and then told me about a monthly meetup group he helped run about atheism/skepticism. \n That group then proceeded to be my primary social circle; while the vast majority of the people there I only see during the meetups, a handful of us see each other relatively frequently. Less so for me since most of em work 9-5 jobs and I still work retail."]}, {"subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "posts": ["I think saying culture and people are too specific. \n People are influenced by things. That's really about as specific as you can be when it comes to music. Influenced by what other forms of entertainment they consume. What they see on TV. What they hear about. Just a general interest in music. \n For example, I listen to Japanese pop music right now. One of my friends who I don't really talk to anymore used to listen to Jpop before I actually met him, but I'm relatively sure that has nothing to do with it -- mostly because he really only talked about it after I had started getting into anime. And he only mentioned it in passing, like he mentioned a group I had never heard of and that's about it. Most of the friends I have who are into Jpop are friends I've made specifically through Jpop sites. \n I can trace things like this: \n I've been playing video games all of my life, and while I was growing up I played a significant amount of games from Japan. This probably opened me up to \"things from Japan\" in general. Most music in video games (especially in the early consoles) were a bit more obviously electronic.. that would eventually get me into industrial (Rammstein, Wumpscut, etc), which opened me up more to music that was  just  electronic/instrumental. It also opened up me to music from other countries. I think the next genre I got into was trance (mostly from Sweden), but another thing also happened. \n By 2000 I started getting into anime. This also continued the trend to me starting to like \"electronic\" music more. I started getting music specifically in Japanese for the first time. I branched out a little bit, got full CDs from groups who did songs for shows I watched, but mostly just stuck with that. By 2005 I stopped watching anime and my interest in jpop in general kinda fizzled out. \n I think by then I had rediscovered trance and was getting into \"goth metal\" such as Within Temptation, Leaves' Eyes, and company. I think I got into goth metal because of old school World of Warcraft PVP videos. \n In 2010 I started getting into Starcraft 2.. for those who know about SC2, know it's  VERY  popular in Korea. This eventually got me into kpop. \n Superficially, there's not a whole lot of difference between jpop and kpop. Kpop is a lot more obviously influenced by the west, but it didn't have the overt sexuality that always kinda made me not like western pop. Both Jpop and Kpop have idol concepts for their groups -- mostly singing and dancing. Never write their own songs of course, and the most popular groups are young women/girls. I got into that for a few months. \n Somewhere down the line, I don't particularly remember. I think it might have had something to do with that friend I mentioned earlier getting an asian GF and talking to her about jpop for some reason.. and then him talking to me about jpop. I started looking up old songs I remembered (such as  this one .. I had ventured into /r/jpop a time or two previous to this, but it's a relatively low traffic subreddit so it didn't hold my attention for long. For whatever reason I decided to make a thread in /r/jpop basically asking what I had missed in the seven years since I had been in jpop last. Got quite a few answers and eventually got a decent source to get that music from.. I was addicted again.", "The first thing is that not all fast food is created equal. Calories in themselves do not matter; what matters is the effect of those calories on your body. \n Most people seem to focusing on nutrient density vs calorie density. That might explain why eating a 600 calorie meal is better \"spent\" on rice, beans and tuna, but that doesn't really explain why someone who eats rice, beans and tuna is likely to live longer than someone eating whatever they want from McDonalds. We honestly have no clue what's \"necessary\" for any individual when it comes to micronutrients. We realize many circumstances where specific micronutrients, so we're told we need them to be on the safe side. That's why a \"balanced diet\" makes sense. \n However, what we eat affects what micronutrients we actually need. This means that no individuals micronutrient requirements are likely to ever be the same, unless they eat exactly the same food. As an example, if you do not eat much meat, you will need to ingest more vitamin C the more glucose/carbs you ingest to avoid getting scurvy. Glucose follows the same absorption path as vitamin C, and glucose uptake takes priority over vitamin C. \n We can't make any predictions by comparing something as nebulous as \"fast food,\" but looking at McDonald's meal builder -- we can have two cheeseburgers with no bun, a side salad with ranch dressing and a water to drink. This adds up to 490 calories, so actually a little on the low side. This also avoids all the stuff which  actually  makes fast food unhealthy for you, namely the fries and the coke. The carrots and grape tomatoes in the side salad make the salad a little high carb for my liking but still pretty good. \n I think when you compare the life expectency and quality of someone eating rice, beans and tuna all of their life and someone eating my example McDonald's meal all their life.. their difference in outcomes will have MUCH more to do with their genetics, stress level and other life habits they have than the food they ate.", "From the [faq]( \n >How is a submission's score determined? \n >A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not \"real\" numbers, they have been \"fuzzed\" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example,  if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are \"fuzzed\".", "Does fat make you gain body fat? \n Strictly speaking, energy balance is what makes you gain body fat. If you eat more than you will burn, you will store fat. However, energy balance is not as simple -- our expenditure depends on our intake and our intake depends on our expenditure. I'm no fan of energy balance as a prescription for weight loss, but it is, literally, what makes you gain or lose weight. \n The effects of the fats you eat have a lot more to do with what you're eating with those fats than the fats themselves. McDonald's and company get a bad rap for their burgers, but it's not the burgers themselves that are doing the damage -- it's the fries, the heavily processed bread and ESPECIALLY the soda that is doing the damage and likely making you put on weight if you're predisposed to insulin resistance. \n >When people say there are good fats (peanut butter?), how do you tell the difference? What does saturated fat do, then? \n The difference between a saturated fat and an unsaturated fat is that a saturated fat is solid at room temp, while unsaturated fat is liquid at room temp. \n I don't think there's such a thing as a \"good fat\" or a \"bad fat\" as long as you're eating real food. While there might be a concern for someone about their ratio of omega 3's to omega 6's, you can't tell that by looking at whether or not something is saturated or not. That being said, I also think the claims about omega 3's are overblown and not really that big of a deal as long as you follow my next sentence. \n Stay away from vegetable based oils (save for olive oil I suppose) and you should be fine from that respect. \n >Trans fat? \n Trans fats are generally considered bad, although I think there is at least a slight difference between naturally occurring trans fats and ones that are created by partially hydrogenating something which isn't normally high in fat like, say, corn oil. Though it's possible naturally occurring trans fats just don't happen in the volume they can unnaturally so I wouldn't go out of my way to get \"natural\" trans fats. \n I haven't done a whole lot of research on trans fats in particular, but I don't really have them very often either. \n > Are carbs what make you gain body fat? \n I could make a whole post about this topic, but I would say: it depends. If your family is predisposed to diabetes and/or insulin resistance, you would likely benefit from, at the VERY LEAST, cutting out pretty much anything that isn't real. This means stopping going to fast food and pretty much only shopping on the parameter of the grocery store, although you'll want to avoid yoghurt too. \n There was an observational study done (called the A to Z study, if I recall) where those with insulin resistance had better results from a low carb (Atkins) diet, while those with no/low insulin resistance did better with a higher carb content. Nobody perfectly adhered to their diets by any means (so it's realistic in that respect), but it goes to show that nutrition is a whole lot more complicated than people want to think it is. Everyone's different. \n Speaking for myself, I feel the best when I only eat meat. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone else, but it works well for me. Most people who see me eat with any frequency think I believe carbs are the devil or something, but I don't. I reserve that title for sugar. ;) \n >What is the difference between something with high calories with low fat and/or carbs and low calories with high fat and/or carbs? \n I'm not really sure how to answer this question. \n Calories are ALL made up of macronutrients, which are carbs, protein and fats. If you have something that is high calorie, it will generally be low in fat, high in carbs or low in sugar, high in fat. Of course, you could just eat a lot of chicken breasts if you don't want either fat or carbs, but chicken breasts are bland as shit. \n >What about low fat/carbs and very high sodium? \n What about them? Sugar and processed foods negatively affects your blood pressure a whole lot more than salt does. I would agree with advice for someone to go light on the salt if they already have a blood pressure issue, but there's a much bigger issue than salt if they have a blood pressure issue.", "Taking this stupid question seriously for a split second, why is it \"offensive\" to ask someone (black or not) why they like something? Yes, I realize you have weird reasons for wanting to know, but you can always take an interest in something your friends are into, even if you don't want to like it. \n That being said, I guess it's true most of the people I've met over the course of my life who also enjoy anime have not been white, but they've also not all been black. Maybe all of my white friends are just boring, and TBH most people I know aren't interested in anything outside of America so it's a very small sample anyway."]}]}

Communicating with the police was an entirely different harrowing situation. We talked to the police by way of a translator whose FIRST DAY ON THE JOB was that day. We got some information, but not enough for it to be entirely communicable, or even intelligible. \n Finally, the police decided to call hospitals. My friends and I were getting incredibly nervous. \n Then we pieced together the news. \n Our friend was in a burn unit on the east side of the city. \n What we came to find out was that our friend had met some London 'bobbies' who bought him a shot. A B-52. It's known that you have to blow out the flame before you take the shot. Our drunk friend didn't. He took the shot, and the alcohol poured onto his face and neck. What made it worse was that they didn't even do anything. He miraculously ended up in a cab, it took him to one hospital, then an ambulance took him to the second hospital to a burn unit. \n After we picked him up from the hospital, we took him back to our hotel. I was the one who was designated to contact our program director. She was calm, but I'm sure she was seething inside with rage as I recounted on the phone, in German, what had happened.

For them, no emotion is from the spirit, and therefore cognitive dissonance requires them to abandon even their own former witnesses, and dilute them whenever possible by identifying false-positive \"spiritual\" experiences in an effort to prove their current correctness. \n Conversely, many who are in the church likewise express their piety by attributing every emotion to a spiritual prompting, looking for meaning in the slightest twinge of feeling. For them, every emotion must have a divine connection, no matter how strained and they fall again and again into the post hoc fallacy, identifying bad news from that evening with the 'bad feeling' from that morning, saying \"Ah. So that's what that feeling was all about.\" \n Both positions suffer from the same flawed perspective of what it is to be touched by the Holy Ghost - that one certain emotion or experience like peace or frission or foreboding or chills is  always  from the Holy Ghost. \n All swallows are birds but not all birds are swallows. I think that we often confuse birds with swallows when it comes to the spirit and how it feels to be visited by him. \n Sometimes a feeling is just a feeling. \n But, YES,  Sometimes  the spirit can and  does  use our feelings to get our attention. I daresay that most of us could look back at our lives and see at least a couple moments where it would be reasonable to say \"yes, that seems to have been spiritual in nature.\" \n Yet at other times, we feel  nothing  while being acted upon by the spirit. \n Stories of feeling nothing \n For example, I remember once giving a blessing and feeling nothing special, as well as absolutely ruining the words and phrases (it was in another language that I hadn't a good grasp of.) I felt ashamed at my language blunders and quickly left the room when I had finished. Yet the next day, I was told that I had  recited  portions of this person's patriarchal blessing to her during my blessing, using language patterns that were so advanced I, in my linguistic immaturity, had mistaken them for gobbledygook.  There had been no \"feeling\" but there is no denying that the spirit was in control, as I had prayed and hoped for him to be. \n One of the turning points of my life was when I was sitting in the back of the chapel preparing a sunday school lesson as sacrament meeting was about to begin. The bishop approached and said, with complete sincerity, something like \"Woah, there is a lot of spiritual power back here!\" I remember saying \"really?\" because I had felt nothing. I had been praying and studying and trying hard to get spiritual guidance on the lesson, but had felt nothing. The bishop reassured me and said \"yeah, there's a really strong feeling here. I can tell you've been preparing hard.\" His kind words gave me the confidence I needed to feel that I was capable of bringing the spirit to a lesson - something I had doubted. \n Sometimes we don't pay attention.  For example, I remember taking a missionary prep class.  I zoned out as the missionaries gave us their example \"first discussion.\" They shared the story of the first vision and, having heard it before, I didn't really pay attention.  However, at the conclusion of the first vision story a missionary looked right at me, of all people in the class, and said \"onewatt, how do you feel right now?\"  I was a little surprised, and annoyed because I didn't feel anything but bored.  However, wanting to be honest in my response, I paused and genuinely examined my feelings. To my surprise I felt a deep, underlying layer of peace - something I didn't expect at all and just hadn't noticed. I said, completely honestly, \"I feel peace.\" The missionary said, \"that feeling comes from the spirit witnessing that this is true.\" He was right. \n So what  does  the Holy Ghost feel like? \n But I personally believe the sensation of the spirit is something else - not an emotion. Emotions like peace, love, serenity, frission, excitement, and so on - those are just emotions. The spirit can trigger them within us if we're not paying enough attention, or if we're not yet able to detect his presence without such stimuli. They can also be triggered or even turned off by changes to our bodies, so it makes no sense to say \"that's the spirit.\" In my opinion, the sensation of the Holy Ghost is something altogether different. \n The crazy thing is that once you experience it, you start to recognize others who have \"been there.\" It shows up in words they use, testimonies they share, and how they choose to describe certain events in their lives. Even in virtual environments like reddit you notice certain words or phrases that belie a shared experience that can't quite be described in a satisfactory way. Because you can't describe it. It just doesn't happen. In my opinion, this is what Elder Packer was talking about in his analogy about the taste of salt. The sensation of the Holy Ghost is an experiential knowledge and can not be transferred via language. \n There was a young man at testimony meeting last month who got up and spoke and tried his best to describe something that had clearly been outside the realm of his experience to that point in his life. He couldn't find words that worked, and settled on making big gestures and trying phrases like \"wash over me\" and \"like fire\" and \"unbelievable.\" For him, the Holy Ghost had suddenly become far more than the \"good feelings\" he had been taught in primary. \n As far as I can tell this kind of encounter with the Holy Ghost is quite rare. Like once in a lifetime rare. For most of us the spirit is identified not by a  unique  feeling, but by the  results  of the presence of the spirit. For example, a sudden understanding, an outpouring of knowledge, an impression to act, or a sensation of light is as close as we get to it most days. \n For example, when I was considering a mission I watched general conference all alone. I was already 23, and I thought there was no point in me going. So I told myself \"All right, if one of the prophets gets up and says 'The spirit has prompted me to tell somebody named onewatt to go on a mission,' then I'll go.\"  Yeah... Anyway, at the end of the conference, surprise surprise, nobody had said anything. Finally it was President Hinkley's turn to speak to close the conference. I have no idea what he said but the instant he opened his mouth I was filled with the absolute knowledge that it was time to go. There was no feeling with it, just knowledge. \n I think that not allowing us to often experience a  unique  sensation from the Holy Ghost is by design, and it allows us to choose to believe in inspiration from above, or to choose to believe in intellect from within - without condemnation. I also think that's why the Holy Spirit relies mostly on triggering our own emotions. It helps us be free to choose what to believe. It gives us as long as we need to develop our own relationship with the Holy Ghost, without getting into trouble for ignoring him in the past. \n /rambling", "Differ if you must.

We ended up in SLC and enjoyed \"The City\" for a while. After midnight we were still out, just walking around temple square. \n This was back in the days when the temple was surrounded by a cast iron fence. We turned the corner from the north side to the east and came across a small group of people standing outside the temple fence in a huddle. After a moment we realized they were chanting something. After a moment, one of the men ducked down and reached through the bars of the fence and scooped up a handful of dirt from the flower bed on the other side. He handed the dirt to a woman at the center of the huddle. The chanting increased in intensity. Once they finished, the woman carried the dirt back to the fence and replaced it in the flower beds. The little group dispersed - each person walking away in different directions. \n My friend, always charmingly abrasive, shouted \"Your chanting versus our priesthood? Good luck with that!\"", "I remember once or twice we got a bunch of junk food and tried to treat it like the superbowl. It didn't stick. \n Nowadays my wife and I tend to sit with our laptops open and half-listen, half-social media. Which doesn't lead to paying attention very well... \n We do always try to get together with family though, which is nice.", "May I suggest something in story form? \n My first, oh, two dozen trips to the temple were similar. Specifically in that  while in the temple  I realized just how shallow my emotional connections with others were, or how prideful or distracted I am. Or how covetous I am. \n Those trips became full of fervent prayer. I often would get so focused on my silent prayers that I'd almost miss the 'action' parts of the ceremony. My prayers and meditation were focused on my struggles - on my flaws - and asking for help. Again and again I would beg for assistance. \"help me let go of this anger\" or \"Help me actually  love  my friends\" etc. And sometimes, not always, but sometimes, I would feel the reassuring presence of the spirit, not connected to the temple specifically, but helping me feel that these flaws would be overcome. \n I learned there that sometimes the Lord uses the temple to teach us about ourselves - to push us to a higher standard of spirituality. And those lessons can be very hard. But I also learned that through prayer and humility, we can change.  That's the whole point of the plan of salvation.  We improve with the help of the lord if we want it, and by making the temple experience challenging, he helps us want it more. \n So if you're seeing more flaws, finding more that worries you about yourself, and are disappointed in the spirituality of your experiences, it may be simply because God now trusts you enough to show you ways you can start working on improving. God may be giving you a reason to stretch yourself even more than you have before - to claim communion with him. \n I remember my dad telling me about the powerful spiritual experience he had when confirmed a member of the church. I was  so  disappointed when I felt absolutely nothing at my own confirmation. It wasn't until I made an effort - like Enos, on my knees, determined for an answer - that I finally connected and had that experience.

Unlike the typical sword-and-sorcery fantasy that feels redundant and mastubatory, this fantasy novel is written with a literary perspective and historical sensibilities that outshine the haphazard writing styles of most modern fantasies in the same way that the bat-signal outshines christmas-tree lights. \n Shades of Grey  by Jasper Fforde - a dystopian sci-fi that could reasonably even be called YA fiction; this book is the most creative and unique sci-fi I've read in years.  Again, this is a novel that abandons the realm of 'typical' and embraces creativity on a level that can only be called mind-blowing.  The premise is so out-there that it takes the entire book to reveal it, giving away hints of the world .  Nothing is handed to you for free, and that includes the solution to the mysteries surrounding the antagonist.  Not only is it an inspiring creative work, it's gripping in how it illustrates that a simple right and wrong are impossible, even in a world of black and white. \n Anubis Gates  by Tim Powers - this is a stunner of a time travel story and a great example of how amazing this author is.  Every time you think the story is about to be resolved things become only more complicated until you think that surely, there is no resolution possible.  Powers ties a tangle of a story and then, with a few tugs of magic and science unravels the mystery.  Powers sees no distinction between fantasy and science fiction and blends the two with stunning ease.  His novels combine ghosts, magic, science, mythology and reason in a perfect blend that will stick with you long after you put down the book. And, like  Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell , the world  Anubis Gates  is set in is our own. Read  Last Call  after this one.", "If you're looking for something fun, but not weighted down like Jordan, avoid  anything  by David Eddings.

Start with, say,  Reaper Man  or  Men at Arms .  I think you'll be pleased with how far your entertainment dollar goes.  Plus it's still in the \"Fantasy\" genre, though not so deep as the \"Swords and Sorcery\" area. \n You might try the  Magic Kingdom of Landover  books by Terry Brooks.  The writing style is fast paced and the universe is interesting enough to immerse yourself into a bit.  I believe the first in the series is  Magic Kingdom for Sale . \n You may enjoy venturing out of the \"Traditional Fantasy\" district and visit the \"Modern Fantasy\" suburb.  Writers like Neil Gaiman and Jim Butcher may be sufficient to turn your heart against the \"Sword and Sorcery\" borough forever, leading to an semi-enlightened and self-righteous journey through the sprawling city that is main-stream fiction.", "There's about 20 more books not pictured here, plus more books from previous years.

Not exactly a tech support tale, but sorta. \n 1998 / 1999. In college dorms. \n They 'set up my computer on the network' which basically means they just installed netware.  In addition to requiring me to log in on my own computer it gave me access to some shared drives on the school network. These are meant to be used by people in design classes, or programming classes, or by those who need to download a program from their class onto their personal machine.  I start poking around in these drives. \n In one of them I find a folder full of about 5,000 subfolders, arranged by name. I look, and, sure enough, there's me. I open the folder and find - all of my identifying information. Social security number, drivers license, address, etc etc. \n I check and, sure enough, I can get the personal information of  any  student I want.  What security measures were there? None. None at all. If you had an account at the school you could simply  take  the information. \n I tried to think about what to do for a few months. Should I tell administration? I'd got in trouble for 'discovering' mistakes before. Should I at least delete my own information to save my identity?  (back then identity theft wasn't really talked about, so I wasn't really worried.) \n My next-dorm neighbor was a Billy-bo-bob-joey-ray, a shy kid who liked to play starcraft with us on thursday nights. We would go over to the 24-hour student computer lab, load the program onto 8 computers there, (against the rules, of course, but the lab tech was also a crafter) and play till dawn.  One problem, though, if you left your computer logged-in in your room you couldn't have a second log-in in the lab. Billy-bo-bob-joey-ray always seemed to be able to log us in, though. We figured he had a buddy in the lab admins who gave him unlimited log-ins. \n Well, about the time that I've decided to let the administration know about this security problem BBBJR just vanishes. Nobody knows where he is. The next day there are federal agents in my room, talking with my roommate about how he knows BBBJR and if he knows of any illicit activities. \n Turns out Billy-bo-bob-joey-ray had installed keyloggers on most of the university lab computers. Why? Well aside from the see-if-I-can-do-it feeling we all have, he had simply wanted to catch a bunch of log-in information so that on game night he could always have a way to let all his friends play without the hassle of running back to the dorms. In their panic, the university administration pressed every charge they could think of and BBBJR went to jail for a little while. \n With some nervous tugging at my collar, I chose to  not  tell the administration about the bigger problem they had. As far as I know that security problem existed for another 6 years. Heck, it may still exist today in some form or another.", "Moments ago, so maybe this was just funny to me, but maybe it's funny in real-life too... \n Caller: \"I just bought a router from derpmart.

Pink had been having problems with her internet not working. She assured me she had re-started her computer and her router multiple times, but to no avail. A quick glance into the tower revealed that her antenna on her home was not connecting. \n Okay. I got this. Probably just no power getting to the antenna. \n I have pink follow the cable from the router towards the wall where it comes in from the external antenna on the roof of her home. Halfway there she finds a little box which sends power to the antenna. (POE) \n Sure enough, the normally green light is orange. I have her un-plug the box and plug it back in again. Still orange. \n I send a tech with a new POE. He installs it easily enough, but still can't get a signal. Weird. He goes to check the antenna outside. He stands below the house, looking up at the roof. There's a TV dish... but... There, dangling from the attic vent is a frayed cable. \n \"I don't see your antenna.\" he says. \n \"Well where did you put it?\" Pink asks, belligerently. \n \"It should be right there. What's with those cords hanging out of the attic vent?\" \n \"Oh, that. We just pulled down that old extra dish the other day. It was ugly.\" \n Long stare. \"And when did your internet go down, exactly?\" \n yeah.", "This is really dumb, but the 'repair' I'm most proud of happened a year after I had left tech support. This was back in 2000 or so. I was a new R.A. in the dorms at my college and had left tech support behind. For some reason, word had leaked out that I was 'good with computers.' \n Well, come move-in week, a girl appears at my door. \"Hey,\" she says, \"I heard you might be able to fix a computer?\" \n I follow the girl to her dorm room where her dad has set up her spiffy new e-machines computer for college use. \"Nothing shows up on the screen,\" he explains. \n I turn on the tower. I hear the fans whirr up, see the lights turn on, hear the video-card beep. I look up at the monitor and suddenly  inspiration strikes. I reach out a hand to the little knob at the bottom of the CRT labeled \"brightness.\" \n \"I tried that already,\" dad says. \n Lo, and behold: the brightness knob was all the way down. Problem fixed forever. \n Probably my fastest fix as well. \n 10 minutes later the girl is back at my door again. \"It's not working again?\" she says. I wonder what could have possibly gone wrong. \n I walk in the room again. Again, the dad says \"the screen is blank.\" \n Thinking to myself  well, tech support means the most insane solution works , I reach out to the 'brightness' knob again. \n Dad says, \"I already tried- oh.\" \n The screen comes back. Again. \n I like to tell myself that the girl found me so attractive that she adjusted the brightness again just so she could have me come back to her room. Yeah. That's what it was.", "I work at a small Wireless ISP. Basically how that works is we provide internet signal through wireless antennas which we attach to the roofs of customers. Those antennas point at a few towers around town. \n One retired gent was having a dickens of a time getting reliable service. Things would be fine in the evenings, but during the day his signal would drop randomly. He said \"Something about it being after 5 just makes it work better.\" We tried replacing his router. No good. We tried every different channel on his router. No good. \n We watched signal strength on his connection. It was great. He should be just fine. There didn't seem to be interference from trees, but he cut down the trees in his yard \"just in case.\" Dude wanted his internet. \n Even though the signal strength was great, we tried using a new antenna. Nope. Still dropping. Set him to a different AP on the same tower? Nope. Tried a totally different type of equipment (older, but still sufficient for his needs), useless. \n We were out of ideas. The head tech was planning to tell this guy that maybe he was destined to use the pathetic DSL from the local phone company. \n As tech was out on his final visit, he climbed up on the roof and looked at the line of sight from the antenna and pondered the situation. The view was perfectly clear. Not an obstruction in sight. The line of sight crossed over a couple of buildings, a highway, the local lumber mill, and up to the tower on top of the hill just about a thousand feet away. There was no reason this guy shouldn't have the best internet in town. \n From the mill came the sound of the big saw starting up. A few moments later the tech heard the customer's dismayed \"Awwww, nuts.\" of internet disconnectivity. \n Somehow the big saw at the lumber mill was disrupting the internet signal. 5pm would roll around, they ol' boys would get off work, and the internet would be fine. \n Tech sighted to a new tower, much further away, but still an acceptable signal strength. Made adjustments in system. And connection was restored. The people rejoiced. Muffins were had by all."]}]}

I also miss being able to grapple into the side of stages with adult link. Seems he can only grapple edges now. \n As for upsides, I can't even list them all. Lucario was a complete blast, mario felt powerful and really good to play, I was able to keep up with a good falcon player with my bowser and using what I saw in your video I was able to do some pretty crazy stuff with ness. Though, sometimes when I DJC I would float off into the air. It felt like there was some timing window I needed to hit to stay low to the ground but regardless, incredibly fun to play with his down-b as shield pressure. \n The character that most surprised me was Charizard. His kit is pretty sick and he actually has some pretty great combos and gimps that he can pull off. His dair has very low delay and startup so he can really spam them out over someones head and remove a ton of their recovery options. \n I of course played a ton of Falco since hes my main and he felt pretty similar. His Fair is a little weird and he felt a little more stiff but I was still able to pillar, combo and tech chase just fine. \n After just one night of playing it I am dying to play more. I really want to buff up my mario game and maybe pick up lucario. I was having a really hard time getting a grip on lucarios up-b (I also haven't entirely figured out his down-bs mechanics) but I am sure I will figure it all out soon enough.", "I have been playing melee on and off competitively since 2004. I main Sheik and am generally one of the better players in my region. Leading up to smash 4 I didn't play any melee (I was focused on other games and just anxious to play smash4). Once it came out I played 100% smash 4 until last week. I also main Sheik in smash 4 and have over 1000 games played as her. \n I went to a melee smash fest last week and most of the players in the room were historically worse than me. There was only one person I felt I should lose to consistently. When I tried to play Sheik I just couldn't remember how to play anymore. I was doing smash4 sheik stuff like approaching with rising fairs, bashing shields with fair thinking I had enough frame advantage to not get punished, needle camping in stupid ways and transforming into Zelda either while recovering or tech chasing in attempts to bouncing fish. No matter what, I just couldn't stop making my hands try to play smash 4 sheik. \n I got fed up losing to players much worse than me and switched to my Melee secondary, Young Link. The moment I made the switch the problem went away. I could play YL up to my normal level of melee play and I started winning all my games. I felt comfortable and confident and did some pretty sick combos. After playing YL for an hour I tried Sheik again and while I was playing a LITTLE better I was still basically trying to play smash 4 and started getting bopped again. I don't play Link or Toon Link in smash 4 at all so I guess maybe I never developed an alternative muscle memory for them. \n Has this happened to anyone else? I have some mental block for my shared melee and smash4 main now. Strangely, this didn't happen to me in Brawl. Back then I mained Falco in both Melee and Brawl and this never affected my performance in either game."]}, {"subreddit": "AskReddit", "posts": ["I did marching band in highschool.

After we were all very bored, we tried to go into the living room to start up some multiplayer stuff he ran to the bathroom and cried. \n His mom scalded us for upsetting him. We tried to explain but she wasn't having any of it. He came out about 15 minutes later of us just sitting around in fake guilt silence and he had a board game. He had made the board game himself for a project in elementary school.

FINALLY! A game I liked. Except, he didn't want to make characters, he didn't want to use a written campaign or map, he didn't want to use dice, numbers or stats, he just wanted to make up fights and hear our responses to them. Problem was he would say \"A Giant spider appears!\" and I would say \"I use a falling rock spell!\" \"your character doesn't know that spell\" \"I use a fireball spell then!\" \"you don't know that either. You only know wind magic\" \"Fine I use a ripping gust spell.\" \"Your spell backfires, throwing the spider at you and it crushes and kills you\". He would do this to every person trying to do anything, killing them and laugh at our deaths. When asked what the hell we were supposed to do or be trying to do, he didn't know. He just said we needed to \"play better\". Like, what the fuck bro, how do I play imagination better? \n My parents showed up at 12:30 to pick me up (as planned) since I couldn't stay the night like everyone else (thank god) and the mom argued with my dad about how he needed to pay her for the food. So my dad asked \"Bench, what kind of pizza did you eat?\" \"we all had cheese pizza\" and the lady called me a liar right in front of my father. My dad asked to see a receipt and she refused.

When one of those boring days would happen I would always be trying to find sneaky ways to sleep but it got me in trouble a few times. Then it occurred to me that there was a supply closet on the 6th floor that no one but me hardly ever goes into. It was mostly boxes full of cables and screws and stuff for computers but there was one HUGE box (think refrigerator sized) full of nothing but packing peanuts. I moved about half the peanuts from that box into other boxes and crawled inside. I fell asleep for FOUR FUCKING HOURS and the logs from the room show three people entered while I was asleep. Since I was entirely inside the box, none of them noticed me. I then slept in this box probably 2-3 times a week. It was very normal for me to come into work, spend an hour eating my breakfast on the clock, say \"I have some tickets to go handle upstairs\", go sleep for 2 hours in the box, and come back down, do work for an hour, eat lunch for an hour, then work hard for 4 hours and still end up getting more done than the head of the department.

You know that I agree with your philosophy on how the card pool for modern should work because its perfectly reasonable. The format has a very lively and active ban list and wizards makes pros play that format at all kinds of events. It would be very easy to spot cards that are too good. Scavenging ooze would be the best thing the format gains. Mimeoplasm might see play too. But if something is too good, they can just ban it. \n The only problem with the 2 rules you listed is it could be moderately hard to track. Like, berserk was in FTV but wouldn't be legal. That could be confusing to people new to the format. Likewise, judge promo karakas wouldn't be legal. This doesn't seem like a problem to you or I, because we know better, but I could definitely see those rules causing misconceptions. \n However, I do get them sort of not wanting to make scavenging ooze a legal card in modern. Its kind of legacy priced already, that would just make it worse. The issue there, though, is that Wizards have no idea how to deliver a product like commander only cards correctly. I don't care that you have to buy a whole deck to get him, I care that when a store orders more commander pre-cons, they have to order ALL FIVE pre-cons.

Also, there is usually an opportunity a few weeks before this to load any additional shit you need to take with you into tough boxes to have them mailed over to Iraq in a cargo container (called a CONNEX). \n \n The buses drive you to the nearest airfield which may or may not be on-post.    In the case of Fort Hood, where I deployed from, it was Gray Army Airfield which was off the main post but still military-controlled. \n \n You get off the buses and file into the terminal, where you wait for hours while the jet arrives, is fuelled, and is crewed (they leave a good 6 to 10 hour buffer to give them plenty of time to fix any personnel fuck-ups that may occur such as a missing Private that tries to dodge the deployment at the last second).

Militia in this case does not mean the worst unit, just any lower-powered one (ex Hastati/Auxiliaries as a Roman faction).

Shock and awe routs them, and then you roll up the line", "Honestly, as another person coming from Rome straight to Shogun II, it will be disappointing at first. You're used to the massively varied and exotic units of Rome, where German beserkers can fight Egyptian chariots, and the elephants of Carthage face down the legions of Rome. \n In Shogun, there's only a few types of units, and everyone has essentially the same lineup: cheap spears, cheap bows, spears, kinda spear-like thingies, swords, bows, swords, spear cav, sword cav, bow cav. And that's it. Some ships, but naval combat in S2 is kinda lame in my opinion. \n BUT  you can and will come to love the game. The lack of unit variety, for both you and your enemy, puts more emphasis on battle tactics - you depend on your own skill as a commander to outmaneuver your enemy, rather than depend on your units' stats to carry the battle. A lot of campaign map stuff, including diplomacy, is infinitely better, and it's a visually beautiful game. \n A lot of people, particularly on here, including myself, are diehard Rome fans, and have been pushing for Rome II since Empire; the fact that S2 tends to be our second favorite (tied with M2) shows how good of a game it is.", "The problem is that they  do  keep line cohesion and  are  disciplined. CA introduced this absolutely idiotic unit trait - I think it's called \"Discipline\". Units from \"civilized (Latin + Hellenic?) factions keep the exact shape they were set to before they were given the attack order. They won't spread out to engage the entire enemy unit, but they will stand and die in a nice rectangle. \n It's a lot like Guard Mode from earlier titles, except for one big difference. In old titles, the units  stood still  and held formation, which could be really useful if you wanted to maintain a relatively straight, solid main line. Now, they fucking  rotate . I  think  the cause is that the mechanics of the game determine an imaginary line which is the \"front line\" of every unit. When a unit with \"discipline\" engages another unit, it lines up its imaginary line parallel with the imaginary line of the enemy unit - the soldiers in the \"disciplined\" unit go full retard trying to maintain the units shape and orientation with the imaginary lines. \n This concept in theory is really nice when two \"disciplined\" units with approximately the same width engage one another head on. Two armies each have a main line of 8 pikemen with a unit width of 16 men and march straight at each other - the \"disciplined\" mechanic will actually give an ordered, realistic fight, because both sides are \"disciplined\": their imaginary lines are already parallel to one another, and because \"disciplined\" imaginary lines only move around in reaction to the enemy unit, they stay still and do their job. \n There are three main deviations from this perfect scenario, all of which spell disaster for \"disciplined\" units, and are all much more common to encounter than the nice hypothetical scenario of the previous paragraph \n \n Varying widths: a \"disciplined\" unit engaging another \"disciplined\" unit with a significantly greater width will always be at a disadvantage. \"Weight\", or the positive effect of having locally deeper ranks, is not accounted for in the game; therefore, unless you have pikes and need to have a certain depth for maximum number of engaged spears, there is  no point  in having deep ranks. On the other hand, even in \"disciplined\" units, individual soldiers can temporarily break line to engage in a combat mechanic with another enemy soldier; therefore, wider units have the advantage, because non-engaged individual soldiers from the wider unit can engage the individual soldiers on the flanks of the narrower unit, leading to 2 v 1 scenarios which snowball into crushing defeats for otherwise evenly matched units. \n \n Multiple fronts: this one is very common - a \"disciplined\" unit is engaged by more than one enemy unit. Their \"discipline\" forces all of the individual soldiers to remain oriented \"forward\" as determined the by the imaginary line - only when an individual soldier is engaged in a combat mechanic with an enemy soldier from the \"flanking\" unit can it even turn to face the blatant threat to its side/rear. While two units flanking one is always perilous for the defending unit, \"discipline\" exacerbates the problem. Theoretically, individual soldiers in \"disciplined\" units being attacked from the flank would lose the shield portion of their defense, and possibly the defense skill portion as well, seeing as they are facing away from the attackers and \"unaware\". I'm not sure how the actual mechanics process the reduction in defensive ability, but it's obvious that they aren't receiving the full, \"on the label\" value they should have. \n \n Undisciplined enemies: a \"disciplined\" unit engaging an enemy unit without \"discipline\" is at a disadvantage - the \"undisciplined\" unit's individual soldiers will move and envelop the \"disciplined\" unit, just like a regular unit would do to a unit in Guard Mode in older titles. This in itself is not devastating, as the \"disciplined\" unit knows it is engaging the enemy unit, and while they idiotically remain in place, \"disciplined\" individual units will pivot to engage individual enemy soldiers. The problem lies in the imaginary lines. The game will still generate an imaginary line for the \"undisciplined\" unit for the \"disciplined\" unit to align with - however, that line will tend to move (both translate and rotate) a lot, because it's probably based off of something stupid, like the average position of individual enemy soldiers currently engaged in a fight, or the location and orientation of the \"unit leader\" or \"standard bearer\" soldier, which are now present in every unit in the game. This causes the \"disciplined\" unit to wheel around wildly, trying to maintain shape cohesion and imaginary line alignment, resulting in decimation.", "After a stint of Rome with the 90-man lightning fast OP generals, I came back to Rome 2 for the new beta patch (which is awesome by the way).

Over the years, the other nations of Europe become more and more subjected to EU rules imposed by Britian. \n Meanwhile, America has prospered under trade with Europe. America, one of the two major powers (along with Russia), negotiates a gradual transfer of Canada to American control. Meanwhile, America captures much of Latin America, under the pretense of premptive strike against a second Mexican War. With this extensive increase in resources and material, America adds Hispanics to the Black population and creates a permanent second class.

Britain declares its intention to help, and begins to mobilize. America reveals its secret weapon: a biogical weapon created by testing on the second class citizens. While Britian has nuclear weapons, they are truly unwilling to use them en masse due to their ingrained liberality. America preemptively deploys the biological weapon on the British isles, for psychological effect, Australia, for proximity to Russia, and SubSaharan Africa, for resources. \n Propaganda specialists in Australia and Africa use vaccines to subjugate the populations to America.

He ran across and it broke, he fell through. Being the idiot that I was I went to get him, I could swim, he couldn't, that was my reasoning at least. \n When I reached to pull him out he was understandably panicking and started to pull me in too, the ice cracked and before I knew it I was in the water. I've been told since we were in the water for around 7-8 minutes but I can tell you it felt like an eternity. He clutched onto me so tight and while I kicked as hard as I possibly could, it was barely enough to keep us above the surface. There were a few times that we went under and I was convinced that we wouldn't make it back up. I remember more than anything the dark stillness of it, a senseless, soundless oblivion. At first it felt like we were swimming in needles but before long that became a numbness, I couldn't feel myself kick but I still did, as hard as I possibly could. \n I don't know when he got there but I remember the face of the fireman at the edge of the ice, he had reddish blonde hair and a big beard. He looked straight at me and said \"You you have him?\" I couldn't have spoken if I wanted to so I just let out a yelp, I remember his arm around us both feeling like an oak tree and with what felt like one swift move (but apparently was several attempts) he pulled us out and onto himself, he was on his back and the pulled us all to shore. My older sister was there and my parents shortly after, we spent the day in the hospital and ended up on the news. We were both treated for severe hypothermia but we came out ok.

Thanks for the positive feedback, front page... Yeeesh!! \n It was more of an ode to High Fidelity with the \"Top 5 list\" sort of thing but since you asked; \n I preface this by saying that I grew up learning that it is always better to be kind, generous and polite. I try to give as much as I can and help whenever and however I am able. I was taught to never expect anything in return but I have been helped so many times when I really needed it. I'm an atheist but I do believe that what we put out into the world is what we get back, this story is one that solidifies it for me. \n I spent around 3 weeks traveling through parts of Europe a few years ago and near the journey's end I ended up being near broke (bank card problems) in London while traveling with friends (a soon-to-be-engaged couple) who intended to leave me alone as they had plans to go see relatives on what was our next to last day in town. Even though their relatives invited me and they had extra cash on hand they left me in my state as they felt they might need the cash \"just in case\". To be fair it was the girlfriend of the pair did most of the talking, he was mostly sheepish looks and \"sorry man\", I understood there was little he could do without catching hell for it and I had a history of coming out of things okay. \n I asked them to take some of my stuff for me so I wouldn't have as much to drag around, with a great deal of bitching about it they conceded and tossed it in the trunk of the Aunt's car. It was the one nice thing they did for me in this story but I would come to regret it as I had left my camera in my main bag, instead of my small day pack... damn. At least I had my passport :) \n So there I was, I had just over \u00a330 for around 32 hours in London, the train to the airport cost \u00a310 and the hostel was another \u00a315 so I was in a pickle with five usable pounds plus couple quid in change. At this point I did what any red blooded Canadian man would do and and hit the bar in my hostel (the Generator I believe) as pints were a pound each. I sat at the bar worried about how to get through a day in a city as expensive as London with essentially no money and fuming about how my friends bailed on me. After my second round the bartender asked me if I wanted another, I refused saying I had no money, I told him the abridged version of my tale and he bought me one, this was only the start of my night. \n As I finished my free beer I sought off to go to the check-in to pay for my room for the night. As I was getting up a hand fell on my shoulder, it was a guy a couple of years younger than me, Australian by his accent (Aussies have always been guardian angels for me) and he hands me a shot. The bartender had told he and his party my story and they decided \"We will help this guy.\" They didn't have a lot of cash either but enough to buy a shot for a stranger. They told me they were staying at a friend's flat and for me to save my money and stay with them. \n As we arrived at the apartment I was floored by nothing short of a feast, they had called ahead and told the owners (a couple in their mid 30's) about me and as they were Canadian like me they saw it as their duty to help me. \n A night of beer, laughs and a couple joints I'd though lost since Amsterdam but found in the bottom of my bag later all was right with the world. It was then that best part of the night arrived, one of the flat owner's little sister, visiting from Montreal sat down beside me, calling me \"Toronto\" a nickname they'd all stuck me with. She was a couple of years younger than me and very cute, after a brief introduction she got the nickname of \"Montreal\" (for the sake of the story I'll call her \"Mony\") I joked about how we were supposed to hate each other (NHL reference if you didn't get that) but that I could never hate such a sweet girl. \n I am probably the least smooth guy I know (who has any hope with women at least) and if I girl is into me I usually just think they're being nice,  this was one of those times.  At around 2am the party was basically wound down. The brother and wife had gone off to bed and the Aussies were on the couches and chair. I was out on the small terrace smoking the last bit of the leftover join with \"Mony\". We looked out over a small park who's name I wish I could recall now when I leaned over and kissed her. I thought she would wind back and slap me but she didn't. After a couple of minutes of that she stood up, took my hand and we went back inside (through the window, which I though was awesome) as quietly as possible. Everyone was asleep inside, it turns out we'd been out there for over an hour. \n She led me into her room, I suppose being family had it's perks. She started to get undressed and though I am no casa nova I know enough to take a hint, as I take off my pants I feel the 35 pounds I had started the day with still in my pocket. I had some of the best, quietest sex of my life that night and woke up with a hot naked girl on me knowing it had all been given to me so very generously. \n I was awake before anyone else at around 8am, my flight wasn't until that afternoon so I had a bit of time. I nudged Mony awake and asked her if I could borrow her set of keys. I went down to the corner and grabbed some coffee and supplies and proceeded to make breakfast for everyone I spent every dime I had, save the money I had for the train but it was worth it as amazing breakfast is one of my true talents. \n We all ate together and later Mony and her sister-in-law drove me to the airport, she took a wandering route because her husband heard there was a lot of traffic buildup in the way there. Mony gave me her email and phone number and I gave her mine. We arrived ahead of time and we had coffee and a scone, leaving me \u00a35, which I offered for gas, it was refused. I was hoping to introduce them to the friends I had left my bag with and be able to tell my harrowing tale but they were nowhere to be found. I assumed they had already gone through and would be waiting for me. I delayed as long as I could but when the time came I put my arms around Mony and kissed her goodbye. She had the biggest smile on her face, waving as she disappeared beyond the doors shutting between us. I wish I could tell you this story ends up with us together but it does not, such is life my friends. \n I arrived at the boarding gate and quite a while later my \"friends\" from the beginning of the story show up, huffing and puffing. I took my bag from they guy half of the couple as he was straining to manage both. \"You will not believe the hell we've been through the last day!\" I just smiled at them. A minute or so later, as they struggled with their bags the girl of the couple asked \"Aren't you going to ask us what we've been through?!\" I kept smiling and said \"Oh yeah, sorry. I totally abandoned you there.\" The boyfriend laughed his ass off, as did I. I'm not friends with them anymore but he's married to her bitch ass now I believe. I still talk to Mony every once in a while, usually when one of us tells our version of the story. \n That last \u00a35 I had left over is still on my fridge.", "I've seen it a couple of times. \n In the first I was working as a television news cameraman and arrived at an accident, in fact I was on scene before EMS or Fire. I came up with my camera and the scene was terrible, a small SUV was struck by a elderly driver in a large towncar. Normally I start shooting something like this right away but this time I couldn't, I noticed a young woman laying on the road, she was actually the passenger of the SUV and had been ejected from the car but was still moving on the ground. Myself and another pedestrian ran to her. I put my camera down and we both knelt beside her, she was badly hurt and we could hear sirens in the distance, not more than a few blocks. I know enough about injuries this severe to not try to move her in any way but I put my hand next to hers and told her to hold on. She squeezed my hand a little, looked at me and then up to nowhere and I watched the proverbial \"lights\" go out. \n The second was two years ago. My father took very ill after an untreated internal injury (I won't go into detail on this) but he had been slowly degrading for a few months. I live in a different city so I was only able to spend a few days every month or so with him, each time he degraded more and more. One morning I received a call that he had taken a turn for the worse and was being taken to hospital, my brother in law who has recently watched his mother pass told me \"come out, this is it\" so I was on the first plane out. \n I got the the hospital at 11:30 pm and he was heavily medicated, not in a coma but not responsive. I stayed with him for 14 hours in the ICU while my family took turns changing clothes or getting things from home. They moved him from ICU to hospice at around 1:30. We took him off the meds at 4:00 and we all took turns talking to him. My mom talked about how they met and their wedding. My brother talked about them fixing his basement and I talked about us going fishing when I was little.

A plain woman can become beautiful if you find her mind and heart to be beautiful. If she is passionate and courageous, can love openly and care about others it comes through. In short inner beauty trumps outer beauty  every  time. \n By the same strokes a beautiful woman can become plain or ugly if she is revealed to be a childish/vapid/ignorant/intolerant/malicious person.

I naturally had a fairly deep voice but wanted to get it that \"bit extra\" and good news, there's lot of ways that involve very little ingestion of cigar and whiskey smoothies. \n There are numerous things that come into play, length of vocal chords and activity of the Arytenoid cartilage around them (the box part of your \"voice box\") however, the short answer is it's your Larynx. The tightness of the muscles in your larynx (tight= high, loose=low) factor the most in determining pitch of your voice; this is why your voice might get deeper when you're tired or drunk as the muscles loosen and your voice drops, think of guitar strings with the high E being very thing and fast vibrating and the low E  being much thicker and slower vibrating. Age plays a big part in the tamber an pitch of your voice as the same reasons we get wrinkles and man-boobs give us cool husky voices with the muscles relaxing over time. \n If you're genuinely interested in deepening your voice there are numerous exercises that you can do on your own, as well as training with professional vocal coaches, both of these will give your a lot of exercises that you can do, though be warned if you're going to try it without an experienced person, you can hurt yourself with some of these so above all  don't rush yourself, you can hurt yourself  write that down. There are also far more radical treatments such as surgery, steroid and sulfur hexafluoride (6 times heavier that air, causes your vocal chords to vibrate more slowly, sort of the opposite of Helium) treatments, though that seems like a matter for extreme cases. Smoking also causes these muscles to relax (somewhat, it's more like breaking them down IMO) but obviously don't start smoking just to deepen your voice, start for the same reason any of us do, peer pressure and stupidity!\nI'm sure cigar and whisky smoothies would relax these muscles as well, but it would likely only give a temporary, analgesic effect and may change the range and clarity of your voice in negative ways. \n Voiceover work (the little I've done) has taught me that deeper =/= better but clarity is the real gold it comes to a \"great sounding voice.\" Everyone can have a great sounding voice, it's just a matter of training yourself to get the most out of it, like everything else it life it takes practice and patience...

You will find that you naturally allow a small amount of air as you hum this is one of the key components of using this technique. Basically, you're learning the sensation of making sound out of more of your head. \n \n Fourth:\nPlay around with this for a few minutes, raise and lower the pitch (like in the scene) or hum scales if you like, just make note of the sensations you feel in your head as you change tone or the amount of air you're expelling. You might start to feel a buzzing sensation behind your nose, above your teeth, even behind your eyes; this is part of controlling tonality in a different way then normal. \n \n \n --- At this point you may return your tongue to normal if you haven't already done so. --- \n \n Fifth;\nMaking the same humming, open your mouth and let the sound come out as a tone, I like to think of Zulu singing, very tonal but through both your nose and mouth. I don't know if that's how the Zulu do it, but for illustrative purposes it will do. Sing a few notes, it doesn't matter if you're any good, I couldn't carry a tune is a bucket but that's not the point of the exercise, it's getting your body accustomed to speaking in the same way as you've been humming. \n \n Six:\nSing your national anthem. Seriously, using the same \"nose and mouth\" technique, sing the first stanza or so. If you like you can do the whole song, or other songs, whatever, until you are comfortable forming words with this technique, the feeling in your sinus should still be there if you push it in terms of volume or pitch. \n \n Seven;\nStarting off with single words, try speaking in a note (speak sing, like Johnny Cash) until you are comfortable your are using both your mouth and nose to release air, then slowly try removing the singing tone from your voice until you are speaking in your normal tonality and cadence. \n \n \n I hope this helps, I've tried it with a couple of people over the years and it dis seem to work for them.", "note:  NOT  literally flying.

Higher education costs have been outpacing inflation for decades now. Ask yourself why? We're living in a technological revolution that has made  everything else  more efficient, but higher education is getting  less  efficient. With all of the wonderful tools out there, it should be getting  easier  and  cheaper  to educate the masses. Yet it's not. \n That's because there's no downward pressure on those costs*. The governments see to it that anyone can go to college for as long as it takes to get a degree and they can borrow any amount that it takes to make it happen. That means  everybody  even remotely connected to higher education can reap fat margins. Professors can mandate unnecessarily expensive books. They can mandate physical presence in the classroom even for underclass lectures where a virtual presence would be just as good. Campuses can be built on prime real estate. \n You could go on an on about how the process could be more efficient. And I'm not even saying that it  should  be a bare-bones setup. It's  good  that schools have well-manicured commons areas. I know  I'd  pay extra for a school with pleasant surroundings. It's just that you'll never find the right balance unless there's some downward pressure on costs. \n So coming back from my tangent, you're right that the banks wouldn't assume the entire risk.

The margin of error actually functions as a range, telling us that when the value (percentage) in the sample of what turn out to be one thing or the other (Republicans for example, or in this case, HIV+), the actual percentage among the whole would be expected to be anywhere from the sample's percent, minus or plus the margin of error. if you do two samples, and the value in the sample is within the range of the other's value after computing margin of error, the two percents are in fact, statistically equal, better known as not statistically significant. \n using the example of the percentage of Republicans: if one poll shows that 50% of people are republican, and another poll conducted one month later says 53% are republican, can we conclude that more people have switched parties? well, if the margin of error of the first poll is 3%, the actual rate is anywhere from 47-53%; and if the second poll's margin of error is 3% as well, the actual rate at the time of that poll was anywhere from 50-56%. notice, they could both be anywhere from 50-53% inreality; the results were therefore, nto statistically significant. \n [Here's a handy site that calculates margin of error for you,]( but I'll save you some of the legwork; the male population of those countries is at this time, roughly 65,328,575.

You will notice these numbers overlap well within each other's range.  This means the results are statistically equal and therefore, not statistically significant. \n And that makes sense, since the real world disease rates cited above shows no difference between circumcised and intact men.

So, these westerners go into African villages, try to inform the women that FGM is wrong, but MGM is ok; all the villagers laugh at the westerner's rationalizing, since both are practiced for the same reasons in both cultures. Religion, hygiene, looks, tribal identity, and occasionally sexual control. any and all of these are the reasons given, for  both practices.** \n and in reality, there are also studies she did (they're available on that site) showing that women who undergo FGM are just as likely to orgasm. they just learn to focus on different modes of gaining pleasure, basically. so both are reducing pleasure, not destroying it completely. yet one is banned as a human rights violation, yet the other is allowed based on old excuses. \n While it is an appalling practice, and a violation of human rights, most opposed to it in the west often claim it to be worse than it is. This, in part, is because many of them are rightly appalled by it, since their experience is not biased by the rationalizations and excuses used to justify it in the cultures that practice it. However, it turns out the excuses in both cultures are largely the same for male and female circumcision. This makes westerners (actually, just circumcising Americans and jews/muslims) who learn it to have difficulty justifying male circumcision, also an involuntary amputation of healthy, sexually sensitive genital tissue. so they end up exaggerating the level of harm from FGM, saying it leaves women unable to orgasm or sexual pleasure (never mind that women who undergo it routinely deny this, and studies showing they are just as likely to orgasm) and claim that it is has VERY high rates of complications, based on carefully selected specific examples, even though the actual rates of complications are low. they also then claim it's done in unsanitary conditions using unsafe methods; this is not always true, in fact it is now done by doctors in many areas. they then claim it's about the domination of women by men; yet in the vast majority of cases, it's practiced on young women by other women, who had it done to them by women who had it done to them, and so on. just like a man who has his son circumcised \"to be like daddy.\" \n If you want to see a great example of the American ideology trying to justify male cutting in the face of realities of female cutting,  check this out.  has been fond of pointing out that certain forms of FGM (specifically, breaking the skin of the clitoral hood just enough to draw blood but no more) are in fact, less invasive and less harmful than cutting off the foreskin, yet are still explicitly banned by the Female Genital Mutilation Act.

They build up this whole structure of laws and codes to try and justify people's emotional reactions as having some basis in values, when really it's just strong emotion with no purpose. \n Trouble is heterosexuals tend to have this reaction regardless of their religion, if any. if that person is an atheist, he'll still tend to be disgusted somewhat by the thought of gay sex. he just generally wont have a justification to morally oppose it. but that doesn't mean there's no emotional reaction there, so some of the less emotionally restrained atheists might still act negatively toward gays."]}, {"subreddit": "Feminism", "posts": ["It comes from a culture that values virginity at marriage so that you can be sure that all the children you'll be paying to raise will be yours.| \n yes, I'm sure that's a contributing factor.

So if most real rapes are \"rampantly\" unreported, then false accusation would make up a much higher percentage of the accusations that do go to trial. Comparing the number of false accusations at trial to the number of accusations that never get made makes no sense. \n Actually, if you were going to compare the number of rapes that occur but don't get reported with false accusations, you'd have to compare the number of false accusations that don't get reported to police or brought to trial. That would include incidents such as a vindictive person telling friends that her ex raped her, making it spread throughout a town or school event hough it never happened, just because she is a little unstable and wanted vindictive revenge for the break up. Such an incident happened to my cousin; she never went to police because the \"rape\" never happened, but she sure as hell lied about it to everyone she could. And I dont know how you would get numbers on how often that happens. \n And anyway, the point you made was irrelevant. Even if the chances of a false accusation are smaller than the chance of being raped, It doesn't matter because punishing  false  rape claims is not in conflict with punishing actual rapists. We can punish more than one injustice; no court takes on only one case. \n In fact, the guy you claim to \"disagree\" with pointed out this: \n >From a feminist perspective, surely making a false rape claim seriously undermines women who have been raped and are struggling to be believed?| \n See, every time a rape accusation goes to trial, it becomes widely discussed very quickly. And when it turns out that one of these trials turns out to be based on a false accusation, that makes the public (and juries selected from the public) that much more skeptical of the next accusation, even if it's true. false rape claims are, in fact, a major reason why so few rapes are actually punished, and one reason why many victims never bother to come forward. punishing false rape claims is better for rape victims, and false accuation victims. And it does not run the risk of punishing a rape victim who failed to prove her case; prosecuting someone for a false claim requires affirmative proof that they lied, and the defendant's failure to achieve her burden of proof at the first trial does not prove that she lied. JUries are, and will be, informed of this. \n At any rate, what really needs to happen is anonymity for the alleged victim in the rape trial, AND anonymity for the accused. At least, unless and until conviction occurs. This will cut down on false accusations because someone who is accusing out of spite or to damage the reputation of the accused will have far less incentive to do so. After all, not many news programs are going to run BREAKING NEWS: someone somewhere is accusing someone else of rape, and we won't have any more information than that for several months. stay tuned! \n Yeah, not a terribly interesting headline. further, over time this would cut down on the fear of being falsely accused, preventing many people from being overly skeptical. People would also be more willing to believe the testimony of a rape victim, knowing that she isn't likely to be bringing these accusations just to ruin the reputation of an ex out of spite or something stupid.", "Well there's kind of a cyclical problem here.

Not only did she defend voting for the war, she claims she voted in favor only because she believed the authorization would spook Saddam into surrender...... OK, so what was her plan for if he called the bluff? which he did. what would she have done then? gone into a war that she thought was a bad idea? or not backed up the threat, making the threat of US military intervention have no credibility when it's needed int he future? her excuse is almost as bad as having gone to war to begin with.", "i don't see why either one would lose anything when understood together. I mean, there's no reason the rich couldn't use and cultivate gender roles in order to keep the class structure to their advantage. i.e. create the idea of women's role to be protected, therefore the man has a role as protector; once man realizes it's his duty to protect, he is constantly on the watch for danger, which makes it easy for the rich to fool him into wasting his life fighting in a war he thinks will defend his home and woman there, when in reality he's nearly always fighting because the powerful want their system of economics or power structure protected. this is why so many poor men in the civil war for example, gave their lives to defend slavery, a system of labor which did not benefit them at all, being incredibly poor, and northerners on the other side gave lives to fight against slavery, not because they actually cared about black people, but because the industrialists in the north had a system that didn't mesh well with slavery.", "Ah, I'm kind of interested in your thoughts on women in the field of software.

In fact, they seem to always go about it the wrong way, by asking why young women  don't  have an interest in these fields,  yet fail to ask why so many men are interested.  and there's the key. \n I mean, the attempts I've seen at getting young girls interested have been based on the assumption that they don't see it as appropriate for their gender role, not feminine, and so on. But who ever heard of a computer programming job being called \"masculine?\" It doesn't add up. Yet one organization took the femininity hypothesis to heart recently, and made a video designed to interest young girls in tech. it was simply various images of women in tech settings, but looking very pretty and feminine, trying to associate the two like in those old experiments with the dog and bell. it was crazy, these people really were convinced that young girls were going to be interested in tech because they saw supermodels walk down a runway with the words \"math\" and \"science!\" on the screen."]}, {"subreddit": "MensRights", "posts": ["you'd be surprised. its interesting, because westerners who've attacked female cutting while defending male cutting have actually mischaracterized both practices, and ironically, they've done so in ways that tend to perpetuate female cutting overall. \n Here's a little  fact sheet  as well.

This makes westerners (actually, just circumcising Americans and jews/muslims) who learn it to have difficulty justifying male circumcision, also an involuntary amputation of healthy, sexually sensitive genital tissue. so they end up exaggerating the level of harm from FGM, saying it leaves women unable to orgasm or sexual pleasure (never mind that women who undergo it routinely deny this, and studies showing they are just as likely to orgasm) and claim that it is has VERY high rates of complications, based on carefully selected specific examples, even though the actual rates of complications are low. they also then claim it's done in unsanitary conditions using unsafe methods; this is not always true, in fact it is now done by doctors in many areas. they then claim it's about the domination of women by men; yet in the vast majority of cases, it's practiced on young women by other women, who had it done to them by women who had it done to them, and so on. just like a man who has his son circumcised \"to be like daddy.\" \n If you want to see a great example of the American ideology trying to justify male cutting in the face of realities of female cutting,  check this out.  have been fond of pointing out that certain forms of FGM (specifically, breaking the skin of the clitoral hood just enough to draw blood but no more) are in fact, less invasive and less harmful than cutting off the foreskin, yet are still explicitly banned by the Female Genital Mutilation Act. This argument has been a thorn in the side of defenders of male circumcision, one of whom is Douglas Diekema. Diekema doesn't like the situation, so he becomes chairman of the AAP bioethics board. then, in 2010, the bioethics board announces a [new policy]( arguing that these forms of \"FGC\" should be legalized and performed by doctors, here's a short quote: \n >(The AAP)....\" acknowledges the legitimacy of including cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions when making the choice of whether to surgically alter a male infant's genitals.  Of course, parental decision-making is not without limits, and pediatricians must always resist decisions that are likely to cause harm to children. Most forms of FGC are decidedly harmful, and pediatricians should decline to perform them, even in the absence of any legal constraints.  However, the ritual nick suggested by some pediatricians is not physically harmful and is much less extensive than routine newborn male genital cutting. \"| \n See that? what's going on here, is with the vast majority of medical organizations of the world opposed to male circumcision, increasing numbers calling for bans and discouraging, and the amount of medical and scientific data against it, as well as human rights activists growing in strength slowly but surely in America, and the number of circumcised men speaking out more and more, even forming  support groups  and  charities to raise money to regenerate their foreskins , the AAP was hard pressed to be able to defend their position in support of allowing involuntary male circumcision. this is especially true since they admitted in their most recent statement from 1999 that it didn't have sufficient medical benefit to recommend it, yet they argued it should be allowed based on cultural, religious, and social grounds (an entirely non medical opinion, which gave away their bias.). \n So, rather than taking a stronger stance against MGM, and applying the same standards of human rights and ethics to it as any other surgery, defenders of MGM decided to support more more FGM, as a stopgap measure. \n That didn't go over well. it caused a SHITSTORM of controversy, and condemnations from several rights groups. which lead the AAP to retract the policy within about a month, and publish a new policy six months later. they now claim they never said it. and I especially love [this article,]( about the controversy, which quotes Georgeanne Chapin from \"a group called Intact America\" not mentioning it's a group against male circumcision.", "indeed, great example as well! for reference, here's the article posted in r/oney that I was responding to: \n [A letter to the guy who harassed me outside the bar]( \n And here's the response I made in r/oney that got way too long (sorry! I'm a law student, they teach us to explain too much.) \n >Give it a whirl with coverage of female politicians and ask yourself whether anyone would spend this much time discussing Joe Biden\u2019s hairstyles.| \n ok, now she really has hanged herself with this one. Indeed, the media does and has given as much coverage to his hair style; it's an open secret in politics that Joe Biden had hair plugs. this is often commented on by the media, which from time to time is known to show the evidence of it by comparing pictures of him in the 80s side by side with newer pictures, which make it clear he had plugs at some point. the media, talk show hosts, and [the entire internet make fun of this ALL THE TIME.]( \n And that's JUST Biden. It is commonly noted that balding men have rarely won elections since the advent of television in every home; no one cries foul when pundits openly speculated that John McCain would fail due to voters not liking his bald appearance. Other bald or balding male politicians face this as well, and not just politicians either; DOnald Trump's hair has often been commented on well before he tried politics (I cannot count the times have I heard some comedian speculate about what animal \"that thing\" is made of.) One might ask, is that evidence of sexism towards men? I don't think so. I think more likely, it's just that we humans are very superficial and petty things, and sometimes our media tends to focus on tabloid BS instead of substantive issues. \n However, I will admit that when men in politics DO have hair, their styles are rarely commented on as much as women's. but is that a result of bias against women? well.... I can't help noticing that every man in politics tends to have virtually the same hair style as all the others. Always that 1950s style combover thing, [which virtually never changes.]( The only exception would be black politicians with different hair than whites, but then those black politicians tend to also have hair in a limited range of styles simply unique to black men. See, men know that if they had a varying hair style, they'd be doubted and stigmatized as unprofessional, maybe immature, etc. Whereas women are afforded great leeway in acceptable hairstyles and lengths. But the media is only going to comment on uniqueness; after all, it's not very interesting to converse about how a man has the same hairstyle as all the others. why would they? there's nothing to talk about. but it is interesting to comment on the differences in women's hair style.", "Well, technically she means that she has privilege because she is a female who fits the traditional female appearance and role. Masculine women are often derided, is her point. Similar to how feminine men are often derided. \n People attacking the gaybros subreddit simply do not understand what it's about. In the gay community, there is a lot of acceptance of those who don't fit tradition (ex. feminine men,) which is great. Even celebration of those, as they are just being who they are, which is a right we have fought so hard for. \n But this leads to an almost reverse situation compared to mainstream society. See all that celebration of people's right to be outside the mainstream, has lead  some  people to assume that anyone who fits the mainstream (masculine gay men) is doing it deliberately, trying to put on a facade to match society's expectations. Sometimes that's true, but not always. Some of us are fairly masculine. It doesn't mean we have a problem with the effeminate guys, we just aren't that ourselves. \n There's also a popular gay past time of making fun of society's gender roles and behavior, like when someone is clearly putting on a butch front to impress a girl and ends up looking fake and ridiculous. But sometimes the jokes go too far and become less commentary, more mean-spirited. especially with young people; it's no secret that teasing can go too far. So when I mention some of my interests to some friends, immediately the jokes start about butchness and Home Depot and shit like that. I have lots of gay friends, but only about 2% have an interest in video games, the outdoors, and other \"masculine\" interests that I have. Gaybros is a place where those of us who fall into that part of the spectrum can feel comfortable, where we can have real discussions about our particular interests and preferences that don't necessarily match those in many social groups in the gay community, such as mine. The issue is not uncommon; I have often heard many gay guys complain that it often feels like there's a \"pressure\" to be feminine in some places in the gay community. \n And soem guys who aren't out are afraid to come out because they feel they don't fit in anywhere. Places like gay bros are desperately needed for support."]}]}

Jumping from house to house, city to city, and ending up in jail in every one of them. It seemed like every time the cops were involved, he ended up going to jail. As I was young, it left a pretty big imprint on me. I didn't know he was using meth, and too young to really understand how dangerous it was for him to be driving drunk. Plus, he hated cops. I don't think he ever made the connection that \"Hey, my choices are causing this, maybe I should make better choices.\" So every time cops were involved, he went to jail. And of course, everyone hid it from me because I was so young. In turn, that left me with the impression that every time I interact with a cop, I'm fucked.

And I  knew  I had fucked up this time. I didn't have a way to get out of it like I had with the video game. So when he asked me to step out of the car, I knew I was going to jail. Plus, my gf had like a dime bag in her purse. Probably not the smartest thing to have on you travelling through Utah. We hadn't been smoking, so thankfully it didn't smell.

Oh where to start... \n \n Worked at a limo company with my \"kinda\" ex. We'd split up because I was sleeping with another girl, but we're still fucking because she wanted me back and I wanted sex. Well, we both worked late and the boss was a huge dick. At this point, most of the drivers are done with scheduled moves and are waiting in cab lines for fares. We're bored, so we go into the bosses office. I lean her over the desk and rail her until one of the legs break. Thank god there wasn't a camera in the office. \n \n Working in another office. I'm there in training and this girl is giving me \"fuck me\" eyes the whole time. I've got a girlfriend, but it's obviously well established I'm a terrible man-whore/cheater. New girl also has a boyfriend. One night she's not there, but her friend asks me for a ride home. We get back to her complex, she comes out as her friend is going in and blows me in the car. Afterwards, she goes upstairs to wait for her bf, and I go home to break my girlfriend good. \n \n Same girl. Get to her apartment. Her roomates, friends, everyone is just kinda hanging out drinking and smoking some trees. After a while, I'm pretty fucked up and the roommate is like \"her and that other girl are in there playing. Go join.\" Naturally, I do. Threesome for the win. Little did I know, the other girl was in therapy for a few things, and was terrified that the condom slipped off, even though I never came. Eventually friend falls asleep and my FWB and I go out into the living room. Not even gonna lie, I'm impressed. 7x in one night, two different girls, and I was so drunk/high I shoulda had whisky dick. \n \n Again, same girl. There's apparently a pattern here. So her room is taken by therapy girl and we're sleeping in the living room. With another couple. It's well established at this point that pretty much anything goes in this house, though. So while they're going at it on the couch, we're going at it on the floor. She's riding me, tits bouncing away, pretty sure her and the other girl are battling to see who can wake the neighbors up first. \n \n Same girl. Not sure who was sluttier. Me or her. So this time, we're hanging out with a guy friend of hers, just kicking it. Her and I go home, I text him and I'm like dude come over. Bring some beer and we'll double team her. She's all up for it, he's all up for it, and I'm drinking so fuck it whatever. Not a fan of the devil's threeway and probably wouldn't do it again, but it was fun in the moment. \n \n Ok. New girl. Another office. More \"fuck me\" eyes. Same office as my then gf worked in. New girl is 18, blonde, looks fun. Flirt a bit, get her number. Less than a week after I started, I've got her naked in the back seat of her car. Continued seeing her for a long time. Girlfriend and I didn't share lunches, so me and the new girl would go on lunch (worked late, so it's dark out), drive up this dirt road a ways, then get it on in the back of her car. Go back to work with my gf like nothing even happened. Fucked her in her house, too, while her mom and sisters were sleeping in the next rooms. Then back to the apartment and fuck my gf. \n \n All three main girls from above. I was working at an abandoned factory overnights. I'd wake up, my gf and I would get it on. I'd get to work, talk to the guy leaving, and then text girl one. She'd come out, bring me dinner, and we'd go at it in the couch in the bathroom. A few hours after she left I'd be bored again, so I'd call girl #2. She'd come over, we'd go out to a dark deserted corner of the lot, she'd (unknowingly) suck the last girl off me, then I'd fuck her until we were both spent. Then home to the gf to do it again. That was a good 3-4 months, practically every night I worked. \n \n \n There are many, many more. But they'll have to wait for another night.

Him and I never did anything, but he ate his sister, I ate his sister and gf, lots of titties everywhere. Then, we went into the bed, girls laying next to each other.

Does it still take up system resources? Not much, compared to an equally apportioned (read: With all the 3rd party apps added in) stock build. Does it take up as much room? Not nearly as much as it used to. Does HTC block access to core OS features? I don't know. I've never used a 'stock' sense device. I've used rooted Sense roms.

At the beginning of Halo 2 a Covenant Scout fleet of 15 Capital ships was capable of the following: \n \n Sitting outside of Super MAC kill-zone (remember that they are firing out of the Earth's gravity well) \n Boarding and disabling multiple Orbital Defense Platforms.  \n A Capital Ship reaching earth and deploying ground troops.  \n \n There is no reason that the Reaper Fleet could not do the same on a larger scale. They have capable ground troops and effective ways of deploying them without significant loses. They also have way more numbers than the battle in review (a thousand time more to be specific). Once they're on the ground disabling the power plants that power all the Orbital Defense Platforms is easily possible. \n Being at the bottom of a gravity well sucks for space battles and that's were the UNSC is stuck. It balances out almost every advantage of that holding a defense has.", "Just a couple points of clarification: \n >ME shoots either slugs of tungsten/uranium that's accelerated to superluminal speeds via mass effect fields or in the Reapers' case, end up being directed energy weapons/biotic fields. \n ME shots slugs from about 0.01c-0.02c, which is hardly relativistic speeds, much less superluminal. \n The Reapers weapons function in the same way, it's just that their payload is a ferromagnetic fluid that better transfers the energy. \n >M1-Cain, which is basically a little mini-nuke. \n The M-920 Cain is actually specifically mentioned as not a nuke, it just creates a mushroom cloud. It still isn't on par with ship weaponry. \n >The Empire needs to travel through hyperspace to go FTL while Reapers use some type of alcubierre drive.

Every wiki only lists the Mark II \"Standard\" and The Modified MAC as weapons on starships with the exception the the Infinity, which has new canons listed as \"only seen onboard...\"  The Super MAC is only on the orbital defense canons. The modified is only mentioned to be on Autumn class heavy cruisers, and is never mentioned to be more powerful. \n > Third \n Once again, source? I look for about 30 minutes for this info and couldn't find it anywhere. And those numbers feel unlikely to be that small for something that is mentioned to be an important tactical decision, but if you have a source then I guess that's the case. \n The numbers are also contradictory with your claims that canon on Frigates are light and fast firing when they have a longer recharge time. \n 15-7 for the standard canons makes it seem like each canon takes 15 seconds and the ships with 7 have two. \n And if 15 second is the case you just half my original estimate (unless you can cook up a source for those randomly higher payload values) 2-5 ships to take one down besides the Infinity. \n > Fourth \n I didn't forget. They just won't be effective at all. The Reapers (and all ships in the ME) universe have a point defense system that protects them from things like missiles. And in the case of the Reapers, they're 100% accurate. So they actually couldn't anything with the exception of the NOVA, which the UNSC really isn't going to use. \n > Fifth \n This is an irrelevant  point.

And the simplest way to break this down is to look at the difference between FIP dependent WAR (fWAR) and RA dependent WAR (rWAR). \n FIP is predominantly predictive. From fangraphs: \n >FIP does a better job of predicting the future than measuring the present, as there can be a lot of fluctuation in small samples. \n \n For anyone who understands how it works, it is basically \"What should have happened\", which is a lot more useful for looking in the future. \n \n There is an obvious argument that those who with a lower FIP obviously pitched better because they performed better on things they could control. \n \n \n RA is predominantly descriptive. \n \n By definition, it just describes how many runs the pitcher gave up. It is incredibly simple in that regard. \n \n The argument on this side, is that they performed the No. 1 duty as a pitcher, don't give up runs. \n \n \n If you don't feel like parsing the chart than you should know that Iwakuma led the AL in rWAR and RA9-Wins (both RA components), while Scherzer led in fWAR (the FIP based one). It kind of hinges on what stats you favor the most, and I think it is incredibly easy to make a compelling case for Scherzer, Iwakuma, Darvish, Hernandez or Sale. \n A couple things to note: \n \n Pitching is basically the only part of the game, where we factor a pre-regressed stat into a players value, which logically makes sense given the volatility of pitchers relative to offensive players and the fact that they have less control of BABIP. Take Posey's MVP season last year. We didn't adjust his wOBA ~.020 downwards because his BABIP spiked. \n \n The \"smart, predictive\" SABR stat likes Scherzer more than the other candidates, but yet you would traditionally suspect the BBWAA to favor the old-fashioned and more simple approach of runs. \n \n \n It is that 2nd dichotomy that makes me largely convinced that Scherzer won  in a landslide  (and I'm emphasizing that as a qualifier again) because of his W/L.  Once again I note that I don't think Scherzer is undeserving , just that it is very clear what tipped the balance in most people's perception.", "You were 13th in batting and fielding WAR with 19.8, 9th in pitching with 18.1, and 14th in cumulative WAR with 37.9. This would suggest an 84-78 season. \n \n You're ERA was 0.39 points lower than your FIP. That is a very large difference over the course of a season, and would account for 63.7 less runs on defense. You're defensive players earned you 9.9 of those, so it was 53.8 runs. \n \n You had a Run Efficiency rating (Runs/wRC) of 104%, scoring 28 more runs than expected. \n \n This means that your run differential was about 82 runs higher than it should have been, leading to a new value of +17, which is also about an 84-78 season.", "This is pretty much it.

We were upset because he said many times how he wanted to play with one team his entire career like Cal Ripken Jr. and how the money wasn't a big deal to him.

The only thing stasis has going for it is that it hits through protection, if you take that away it is just a worse form of cc. Also, it'd be worse than warp, because warp does damage and weakens armor. \n When you have everyone who does a gold run with 2 Adepts/2 Inflitrators, then if you nerf those two classes then gold becomes ridiculous. Making the weakest classes better doesn't make a power creep; it creates a more flexible class set-up for gold. \n I honestly do not see the problem with Stasis. It's powerful because it's unique in shutting down Phantoms, which are the most dangerous enemy in the demo. We don't know if that will apply to the entire game. There are probably 10 times as many maps, that probably vary a lot. Then in addition to Cerberus, there will probably be Reapers/Husk things, Collectors, and Geth. Then there's the maybes: Blue Suns, Blood Pack, Eclipse, Batarian Government, other rogue fringe groups that side with the Reapers like Cerberus (think the biotic extremists). So there's potentially a massive difference in the way each map/enemy will play. Maybe some of the more dangerous enemies in the other enemy groups resist Stasis. It's possible that the way that the Stasis mechanic work is that it needs health for it to work, or can't penetrate armor. For the first, that would mean the Praetorians, Scions, and Brutes would be unaffected, as well as other possible Reaper creatures, for the second that would be a whole laundry list of creatures based on what had armor from ME2.", "At higher N7 levels, yes it doesn't mean much. The difference between 400 and 800, 500 and 1000, and 1000 and 2500 usually mean nothing. \n At lower ones, it generally does mean a bit. Awhile back I ran a survey here, and the numbers indicated that players with a sub-200 N7 generally struggled to hold their own in Gold matches. The  average score  were non-existant at the higher N7s with the exception of one outlier, while that seems to be the average for sub-200 participants. \n Things to note: \n \n The average (mode) n7 at the time of survey was somewhere around 300. Now it is closer to 450-500, so the difference between the average player and the average sub-200 player will be more significant. \n \n The average person who took the survey (either from here or BSN) are very likely to be better than the average casual player. This once again increases the likelihood that the random 1xx N7 player in your lobby won't be very good. \n \n \n I'm going to guess it takes something like 4 hours to level up a character from 1-20 splitting between bronze and silver. So including for xp from packs I'll round to 20 hours to 120. A sub-200 player will probably have around 30 hours or less. \n So, they don't have much experience with the game, so unless they're supremely talented or played a shitload of single player before making the switch (which doesn't really adequately prepare you as Silver is just as hard as Insanity) they are very unlikely to be skilled. They're even less likely to know a lot of the nuanced skills or knowledge like controlling spawns, wave budgets, corner peaking with the camera, running backwards with the Pizza, that SMG ULM is bugged, and reload canceling. \n So unless they are something like a 120 no promotion (promoting each class once will bump you up to 300), which I have seen literally one of in the thousands of players I have played with since launch, low level N7s are the following: \n \n They have limited experience in the game. They only have around ~30 hours. If they're below 300 they probably have around ~40 hours. This also includes very limited experience at higher difficulty levels. \n \n They are likely have limited character options. It's unlikely they will have many of the high-tier classes. If they do they probably have limited experience with many unless it was in their starter pack. \n \n They will almost never have a decent weapon selection. They may have the basic weapons maxed, but the few rare weapons will be at a high level. This is a big deal for some like the Carnifex, which is high-tier because its the best weapon to still get +200%, which it doesn't at lower levels. \n \n They will often have limited equipment options, which means that they will either be unable to use them or unwilling in an attempt to save for later. \n \n \n One of these things are usually not a problem in a gold game. But its very unlikely that a sub-200 level players will only have one of these problems. I like winning. I don't like losing. I don't like having to use all my equipment in a Gold match. So if they're a decent power class with a light weapon, then they will probably get a pass (these people are often still the worst in the group), but if they're not I'm voting to kick.

The Mattock is the only uncommon weapon worth using regularly and only it, the Phaeston, Eviscerator, and Tempest are even significant upgrades over the common weapons. Almost every weapon worth using is rare or ultra-rare. And almost all of the rare and ultra-rare weapons are upgrades over every single Common and Uncommon weapon. The Falcon, Revenant, Widow, Claymore, Geth Plasma Shotgun, Graal, Disciple, Carnifex, Arc Pistol, Hornet, Reegar, Krysae, Piranha, Acolyte, Javelin, Talon, Saber, Black Widow, Wraith, Paladin, Harrier, and Typhoon are all better than any other weapon in their class in the common and uncommon tiers. Not to mention almost every single power class is rare. The only uncommon classes are the Drell Adept, Salarian Engineer, Quarian Infiltrator, both Turians, and the Asari Vanguard. You can also get those in PSPs. All the other classes, which include every single top-tier class in the game, are rare.", "I think the Vanilla Human Soldier still has a bunch of residual meh after the falcon build stopped being popular. The game was so much more power/biotic centric before all the new toys, weapon buffs, and buffs/additions of weapons characters. They're not really founded, as Adrenaline Rush is awesome now (70% damage increase over 6ish seconds with 40% DR and 100% shield restore, while reloading your clip is outstanding), but he's still kind of overlooked like most of the Vanilla classes.", "I'll say that there is definitely a legitimate spectrum of how good certain things are in the game. The Arc Pistol and Drell Vanguard are legitimately bad, while the Carnifex and Asari Adept are legitimately really good. That said, a good enough player can take a Drell Vanguard with an Arc Pistol and have success. That's not really the point, though, as most people know that skill is more important than class or weapon. The difference between Drell Vanguard and Asari Adept is relatively huge. The difference between most classes and weapons is not huge. It's actually quite small. The difference between Asari Adept, which everyone says is awesome, and Krogan Sentinel, which gets you kicked out of most gold lobbies, is negligible. Certain classes excel in different areas, which is why overall class comp, is important, but they're almost all just as good as one another if the player is good beyond \"follow the formula=win\" that seems to plague so many people in most walks of life. \n I guess the basic message I'm trying to get across is don't vote kick people because of class, or demand they change. People who do that lack critical thinking skills. Ask them why they're using that set-up. If they give you a logic answer, then A+, let them play. They have competence to articulate their logical goal. You want to play with those people; they're usually good."]}]}

This is very bad for your long-term technical development, so really pay attention to everything; are the muscles at the back of your strumming shoulder tensing up? Is your fretting arm elbow sticking out awkwardly, or pinning itself to your ribs? Are you trying to grind your pick to dust between your finger & thumb, rather than gripping it only firmly enough to keep control of it? \n ~ \n Once you've gotten some confidence with this foundation, try for your |D D DUD |, but  keep your arm swinging in the exact same way as for the previous exercize.  The only difference should be that on the '+'s after 1, 2, and 4, your upstrum is an air-strum, ie (brackets indicating air-strums); |down-(up)-down-(up)-down-up-down-(up)|- your arm swings up as if strumming upwards, but your pick is just far enough out from the strings to miss them. Someone in front of you watching should see virtually no difference in your arm motion for this pattern than for the previous pattern (or the bonus one at the end of this post). Make sure you  hear  those '+' counts in your head, and let your arm swing smoothly upward for them, so your overall timing remains steady. Particularly after the last downstrum, your arm may be inclined to hesitate- make sure it swings upward, keeping that down-up movement steady, or you'll miss the first strum of the next bar. \n It can seem weird and random at first, but as you gain more experience, your ear will get better and better at picking out the counts of the beat, and just dropping the strums in as down on the 1, 2, 3, 4, and up on the '+'s. \n ~ \n Bonus: If you get that one down, try this one: |D DU UD | Another way to put this would be like this, with bracketed movements being 'air-strums': |down-(up)-down-up-(down)-up-down-(up)| Again, your arm swimply swings DUDUDUDU, you just deliberately miss the strings on '+' after 2,  on  3, and on and '+' after 4. The reason this is a little trickier is because of that downward air-strum on '3'; the numbered counts are the  stronger  parts of the beat, so our natural instinct is the emphasize them, rather than leave them out. This type of rhythm is a very basic form of  syncopation : a rhythm (or part thereof) where stronger parts of the beat are de-emphasized, and weaker parts are accented. This (and slight variations of this) is also probably the most common basic strumming pattern on the guitar, very broadly useable in a huge number of songs across many many styles.", "Goddammit NO! Will you people please stop with the \"just practise! Practise practise practise!\" thing as if you are being helpful! \n LISTEN: \n What do you think happens when people keep repeating  flawed technique , day after day, for hours on end? They just get better at playing BADLY! Sure, in many cases, as someone repeats something their subconscious picks up on the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of what they are doing, and corrects them, but much more often this kind of advice causes people to just grind away without paying attention to what they are doing until they hit THE PLATEAU- that horrible frustrating plain from which it becomes impossible to rise off. I hit it myself years ago: I wanted to improve my picking accuracy and speed, so every day, for a couple of hours a day, for  years  I would grind away at the same fucking major scale pattern and never got any better. It wasn't until I realised that I wasn't really aware of  why  I was having so much trouble, and started to really focus consciously on specific elements of my technique, that I began to actually improve. \n I feel really strongly that for this reason it should be against the reddiquette of this sub to smugly say shit like \"Just practise man. Practice practice practice. That's how I got so awesome lol!\" Every bastard  knows  they have to practice, and people who come here are generally looking for  slightly  more specific guidance than that. It's just as useless as people in the main subs going \"lol upvoted\" and \"came here to say this\", and should be treated by the community in the same way: with downvotes.", "Hello. \n This is a great little sub, with many very capable people posting useful and fun links and helpful, considered advice. But in practically every single post where someone asks for technical advice, some genius(es) will offer this incredibly considered and helpful gem, or some variation thereof: \n \"Just practise man. Practice practice practice. That's how I got so awesome lol!\" \n Firstly:  This is completely obvious. Pretty much nobody is coming here saying \"I picked up a guitar for the first time ever today, and I couldn't play any of the Yngwie Malmsteen licks I like. What am I doing wrong??\" Everybody knows they have to practice to improve. EVERYBODY. Tell them how and/or what to practice, or pipe down! Maybe  you  got as good as you wanted to be by just charging forward on your own, but people who ask for advice here clearly aren't achieving their goals with that approach, and/or are pretty sure they are doing something not quite right which will hold them back in their further development. \n Secondly:  This is very often WRONG. If someone has fundamental issues with their technique that are hindering them in their pursuit of their guitar-playing goals, simply repeating this incorrect technique over and over ad infinitum will inevitably make their playing  worse , as tension from struggling becomes ingrained into their muscle memory, making fluid and comfortable playing impossible. And muscle memory is  very  sticky: once your flawed technique is thoroughly memorised, it requires much, much patience and attention over a very long time to train yourself out of your old habits and into new and better ones. \n ~ \n I had a little pm exchange with one of the mods several months ago on this matter, who basically said that he/she hadn't really thought of it before, but he/she saw my point, but had too much going on at the time to look at putting something into the sidebar about it (this is how I remember the conversation going anyway, apologies to said mod if this is in any way inaccurate). \n My plea is just this: Can we please not respond to technical queries with 'just practice' or any variation thereof, unless it is truly the only advice worth giving (hint: it never is)."]}, {"subreddit": "AskReddit", "posts": ["If I understand your question correctly, what would happen is that each interval along the sequence of the cycle of 5ths/4ths would sound more and more out of tune than the previous one (I think, although one of the other comments caused me to think maybe the  harmonic series . \n The cycle of 5ths (stop me if you've heard this one before?), when represented as intervals, rather than specific pitches, runs: 1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, b5, b2, b6, b3, b7, 4, then back to 1. So, setting pitches to be more 'mathematically correct' or 'pure' or 'natural', you would find that the C-G (5th) interval would sound pretty right, C-D (2nd) would be slightly less 'right' sounding, C-A (6th) would be a bit more off, and by the time you got to the 3rd, 7th, and onward things would start to sound really awful. This is why eastern music (*generalising) tends to use only pentatonic (five note) scales, which run 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, using only the first five notes in this sequence. Since they opted not to equal-temper their intervals, using 7, b5 etc would sound awful. With standard, equal-tempered tuning we have the freedom to play in all keys with relative tunefulness. \n NOTE: All intervals can be arrived at from the other direction, ie; C-G is a 5th, but G-C is a 4th. Therefore, a 5th and a 4th are the same in terms of simplicity/consonance/harmoniousness. If the scale was developed in the other direction through 4ths (eg; going from C  down  to F, using 'pure' intervals, the 4th would be the most pleasant/in tune sounding, then the b7, then the b3 etc.", "Aha! Tuning with harmonics IS, indeed, tuning to pure intervals! Again, since the interval you use is a 5th(/4th), the difference is minimal (~2 cents [hundredths of a semitone] I believe). Not enough for all but the most finely trained/experienced/talented ear to detect. BUT, this can get you into trouble thusly: you tune your A to your E, you're a little out (from equal-tempered tuning); tune your D to your A, and your D is further out of tune with your E than your A is; then, tuning G to D you are further out still. Depending on how you deal with the anomolous G-B jump, by the time you get to the high-pitched E string, you might find your 2 E strings to be noticably out of tune with each other - disaster! This used to happen to me when I used harmonics, and I thought it was just that My ear wasn't that great, but actually I was tuning quite accurately, just to pure intervals that inherently go astray! \n Phasing is a good word for that pulsing sound you hear when notes are 'out of tune', but I believe the correct term (in physics at least) is, confusingly enough, a 'beat'. Unfortunately, if your strings are tuned perfectly to equal-tempered pitch, you  should  hear a slight/slow beat when you play the harmonics - outrageous! My mind was completely blown when I learned this, and, of course, I now rely on a tuner or reference pitches to keep my guitar sounding as good as it can. The problem is made worse on stringed instruments, since due to their physical nature it is impossible to set a guitar intonation perfectly for every single note, though there are some nifty workarounds (see: buzz feiten tuning system, fan-fretted guitars etc.)", "The word 'cunt' derives from the word 'coney' (pronounced 'cunny'), which means rabbit.", "Absolute bollocks.

Let's talk about how literally the best propeller aircraft ever designed is currently sitting at  BR 5.7 , not because it's undertiered, but because it performs substantially worse than the goddamn  Tempest V . Right now the best airframe the Brits have is the LF Mk IX Spitfire. This is after giving most of the Griffons BR increases as well. So yeah, I've got plenty to be upset about. The aircraft I main got nerfed hard for no good reason, to the point where they don't even fit their historical roles anymore (tell me more about how the Griffon engine Spitfires, the greatest propeller-driven interceptor aircraft ever built, are out-climbed by their substantially less powerful Merlin-engine counterparts, despite having basically the same airframes).

She's not necessarily a bad plane right now, but she suffers hard from stock syndrome, possibly moreso than the tempest Mk II. And even once upgraded, her high altitude performance is nowhere near as good as a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft's performance should be (those glass circles you see in the side of the rear fuselage are for a camera). So, here are my findings with regards to the spaded Seafire FR 47 with no ordinance equipped: \n Notable differences between the Seafire FR 47 and its land-based couterparts the F Mk 22 and F Mk 24 Spitfires include the following: \n \n It is significantly heavier than the land-based fighters due to its navalization adding extra weight, with the benefit of the aircraft having better energy retention, slightly better structural characteristics, and an arrestor hook \n \n It has combat flaps.  combat flaps .  based combat flaps . \n \n It has 2 3-blade contra rotating propellers, which SHOULD give it better acceleration and rate of climb than its land-based counterparts \n \n As with all Griffons, turn performance is significantly improved if you WEP through the turn, and the SR 47 is no exception, in fact it more than the other Griffons needs to do this to offset its performance loss at higher altitudes. \n \n \n Going off my notes, using a 20 degree climb angle the Seafire FR 47 at reference (which I believe is equivalent to spaded) will get you to 3000 meters in a little over 2:00 minutes, at a climb rate of about 23.8 m/s or 4700 ft/min (this is about 0.6 m/s or 100 ft/min less than it should have). You will reach 6000 meters in just shy of 5:00 minutes (actual is 4:49) for an average climb rate of about 20.7 m/s, or 4150 ft/min, but this statistic is irrelevant and I will tell you why: \n Please note that all of these tests were conducted at an airspeed of between 300 and 400 km/hr IAS: \n Above 6000 meters, this aircraft does not perform well at all: \n \n Acceleration is worse than the Mk 22/24 Spitfires \n It wobbles very wildly in the vertical sense in vertical maneuvers, even with flaps engaged \n It will be out-turned by FW 190s and perhaps some bombers as well \n It will loose horizontal airspeed \n \n Between 5000 meters and 6000 meters, the story isn't much different: \n \n Acceleration is still very poor \n Vertical maneuvering is also still very poor, but at least using flaps you can complete an overhead loop without the airframe wobbling uncontrollably \n Horizontal maneuvering is poor. Bombers might not out-turn you at this altitude anymore \n It will loose horizontal airspeed above 400 km/hr IAS \n \n Between 4000 meters and 5000 meters, performance does get better. If your schtick is maneuver fighting, 5500 meters should be your maximum operational altitude: \n \n Acceleration is still poor overall, but better than higher altitudes \n Decent vertical maneuvering, especially with flaps \n Decent horizontal maneuvering, especially with flaps \n Will still loose straight-line speed above 400 IAS \n \n Between 3000 meters and 4000 meters the vertical maneuvering really improves. Unfortunately, this was also the cloud altitude on my test flight so I couldn't reliably test horizontal maneuverability: \n \n Acceleration is better. The lowest point of \"good\" \n Great vertical maneuvering ability, especially with flaps \n Could not test horiz. maneuvering \n Guess what? It loses speed above 400 IAS with WEP off \n \n Between 2000 and 3000 meters is where you really start to notice performance improvements, but you're not in the sweetspot yet: \n \n Good acceleration, you can recover energy lost in maneuvers after about a minute now \n Loves doing vertical maneuvers, especially with flaps \n Good horizontal maneuvering, especially with flaps \n Will keep its speed up to around 550 IAS \n \n The upper level of the sweet spot for this aircraft is the 1000 meter to 2000 meter range. If you can drag an enemy down here, they will be in for a world of hurt: \n \n Good acceleration, your energy recovery time is reduced to about half a minute \n Do you like vertical kulbit maneuvers? If so, at this alt the SR 47 comes pretty close, especially with flaps \n Horizontal handling is quite noticeably better than at other altitudes, especially with flaps \n Will pick up speed above 400 IAS at this altitude \n \n The 0 to 1000 meter range. In RB its rare you'll be fighting here, but if you can get an enemy here and trap them here it's the functional equivalent of being a serial killer who has just lured their target into a torture dungeon: \n \n Great acceleration, you can very quickly recover from horizontal or vertical maneuvers at this alt \n So that line about kulbits? I'm pretty sure I pulled one when I did the with flaps test of vertical maneuvering at this alt \n Very good horizontal maneuverability at this alt even without flaps. With flaps you may even be able to turn with Bearcats for a limited time \n Will pick up speed at this alt \n \n In general the roll rate was decent overall. Slightly better than the previous Seafire, but not exactly FR Mk XIVe level", "Why do you guys play this? There are plenty of good games out there. \n Not for everyone. If you play War Thunder for full sim aspects, than yes, you have absolutely no justification for playing War Thunder - much better games like DCS and IL-2 exist for full-sim aspects. But not everyone in the world wants full-sim aspects. \n The fact that War Thunder actually has physics and bases survivability off of more than just a health bar already puts it way ahead of its closest (and only) non-simulator competitor, World of Warplanes. And don't even think of listing Ace Combat as a competitor - the only AC game on PC is the shitty one, Assault Horizon, which might as well be CoD with planes, especially with the storyline. \n So we see that for the AB and RB aspects of War Thunder, there really isn't anything on PC that comes close to what War Thunder does.  Now to respond to some of your other points... \n > 8 months of playtime, I didn't unlock a single plane \n I have to wonder what you were researching and what mode you were doing it in when you say this - I'd wager it's probably a jet, and probably one of the top-tier jets at that. Despite that, I still don't think it should take 8 months to unlock a plane. Many of the top-tier jets cost upwards of 360K RP. Assuming you're researching in RB and one match is 1000 RP, that should take about 360 matches to unlock. The only way that works out to 8 months is if you're only playing two matches per day in each nation. That's not a lot of playtime at all, and when it comes to unlocking content at the end of  any  F2P game, you need to put in a time investment. That's just how F2P games work. \n > Gaijinn is a really bad dev team, they don't listen, it takes years for them to make updates, they remove good things etc... \n Don't confuse the devs and their managers. In terms of actual development skill, the devs are actually very good at their jobs. They have a game as complex and good-looking as War Thunder that A) actually works, and B) looks decent even on low-end systems like the PS4. Those are great accomplishments in development. \n As to the second part, development teams rarely directly interact with the community (Though there are rare exceptions like the EVE Online devs who will regularly go on roams and ruin someone's day) - they're usually too busy to do so. That's why PR departments and Community Managers exist. The problem is that with one exception (Batadari), Gaijin's PR and CM departments are absolute utter shit and communicate  nothing , for some completely unknown reason. Whatever the reason may be, however, it's still not the developers' faults. Don't confuse them with the PR/CM departments. \n As for update times... I'm again going to tell you to look at EVE. They've transitioned to bimonthly smaller updates now, but they used to update EVE in a similar way to War Thunder: Two big content patches every year, one Winter expansion, and one Summer expansion. Yes, Gaijin could in theory release things as they're done rather than bundle them into a big update, but doing so prevents you from A) using the update to advertise and B) using the update to do special events for players. Not to mention that the USGF intro showed how bad it would be to implement a tree a little at a time, so thats' another reason why interim content updates are out. \n As for removing good things... blame management. Management is the guys who see where all the money goes, and for them the important part at the end of the day is that money. If their bosses don't like the way the money looks, the managers haven't done their jobs, and this is an incredibly difficult job in an F2P game company. See the managers need to get the playerbase to spend money, but most of the playerbase of course does not necessarily want to spend money. And this conflict of interest very often causes F2P management teams to at best not really care about the playerbase, to at worst outright despising the playerbase. And it's the management team that gets to tell the dev team where to allocate their resources. If management says \"Sim players are too small of a playerbase, so don't allocate as much of your resources to them\", the devs really don't have a choice in the matter unless they can convince management otherwise, since it's management that controls whether or not the devs have a job at the end of the day."]}]}

This is mainly due to Kubrick's visual style. He did multiple things that no one had done before. For example, no sound in space. Most SF films previously had ignored the fact that sound doesn't propagate in a vacuum. Kubrick did things like playing the Blue Danube Waltz, and having you listen to the astronauts' breathing inside their helmets. His depiction of zero gravity was a first. Remember, this is pre-CGI, and making a guy walk through a doorway and turn upside down while he was doing it was non-trivial at the time. He added neat little touches like Pan Am (a major airline at the time) running the shuttle going up to the space station. The film is mostly a beauty to watch, except the star gate sequence near the end (more on that later). \n Kubrick had a great collaborator in making the movie, SF writer Arthur C. Clarke (inventor of the communications satellite). The story came mostly from him, and was sourced from ideas in some of his previous works like \"The Sentinel\" and \"Childhood's End\".

But, so it goes. \n 2nd part: The aliens wanted to know when the monkey-men became a spacefaring race. So they left a sentinel buried on the moon (another black monolith, maybe the same one). When mankind exposed it to sunlight, an automatic signal was sent out towards Jupiter announcing that the kids were growing up and were ready to leave home. The mission was mounted and the crew sent off to see what was going on out there near Jupiter, hoping they might find aliens. (More about this part later.) But the crew wasn't told the whole story about why they were going. \n 3rd part: David Bowman finds another monolith orbiting a moon of Jupiter. When he flies near it, the top opens up and....it's full of stars. It is not full of stars actually, it is a stargate that takes him on a tour of the wonders of the universe. (Unfortunately, Kubrick got carried away with his attempts to make a visually cool movie here, and a lot of this is just crap. But hey, no CGI back then.) At the end, Bowman finds himself in a sterile white room with another of those monoliths. Like in Part 1, it fiddles with his brain (or DNA, or whatever) and helps him evolve to the next stage of mankind's evolution. He is represented as an embryo floating in space at this point. He has more power than humans can even imagine. (In the book, he decides to do something fairly drastic.) \n Back to the 2nd part: There was a subplot with the computer HAL9000 and the crew, playing with the idea of what intelligence really is. (This is a major theme of the entire movie.) HAL was an Artificial Intelligence, and could do amazing things. But he was given conflicting programming requirements...the requirement to keep the mission details secret from the crew, and to make the mission succeed at all costs. When the crew started to question what the mission was all about, he decided that the only way to make the mission succeed without them knowing what was going on was to kill them and finish the mission without them. That achieves both goals! Was HAL driven insane? Was it a reasonable way to reconcile the goals he was given? Was HAL truly intelligent, or did he just simulate intelligence? Did he have feelings? Are emotions and empathy important for an intelligence to have? Is it OK for an intelligent species to create another intelligent species? This whole subplot was really meant to explore those kinds of ideas, since the whole movie was about the nature of intelligence. And remember what the monkey-men did when the first monolith enhanced their intelligence and they first started using tools? \n Anyway, that's a long-winded summary. The trick to enjoying and appreciating the movie 2001 is to read the book first, then watch the movie. If you do, it is one of the great SF movies of all time. And the last few pages of the book are awesome in a way that the movie can't be.", "A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life.  It was mostly stuff he made up (including fake references to scientific research), but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life. \n People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge.  You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, but is certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) \n There's a fairly new book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested.  I haven't read it, but I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way.  Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. \n It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church.", "The first thing to understand is that electric fields and magnetic fields are related (they are actually different aspects of the same thing), which is why they are often combined into \"electromagnetism\" or the \"electromagnetic force\". A changing electric field creates a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field will create an electric field.   And as an outcome of that, a moving electric charge (an electrical current) creates a magnetic field (such as in an electromagnet). \n A \"field\" is a fancy way of saying \"has some amount and direction that changes over positions in space\". Electric charges push/pull on each other at a distance (without touching). We describe how they do that as a field rather than a single number since the amount and directions of the forces vary with position and the amount of charge.  Similarly, magnetic forces vary with position in space and the strength of the currents that are creating them. So we also talk about magnetic fields. \n The electric charge a particle has is intrinsic to the particle.  Usually we are dealing with electrons, which we say carry a unit electric charge of minus 1 (protons are +1, neutrons are 0 charge).  Uncharged particles are unaffected by electric fields, which is another way of saying that charged particles only push/pull on each other. \n Magnetism and magnetic fields are properties associated with electric fields...there is no magnetic \"charge\". Many materials are affected by magnetic fields, but many are not. \n If you think of an electron as a charged particle that spins on its axis (which it isn't, exactly) and that orbits in a circle around the atomic nucleus (which it does  not  do in reality), then you will realize that electrons in materials could possibly be sources of magnetism.   Wait....I said it doesn't do those things, so why would that matter? It turns out that they  act  as if they actually do both of those things.  So for the purposes of this discussion, pretend that those are OK ways to think about things, even though you know in the back of your mind that we're cheating a little bit.  But now we've identified two ways that electrons in atoms can possibly create magnetic fields. \n Now I'll steal from [Wikipedia]( but skip over some stuff: \n \"Ordinarily, the enormous number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments (both orbital and intrinsic) cancel out.... .. Moreover, even when the electron configuration is such that there are unpaired electrons and/or non-filled subshells, it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point in different, random directions, so that the material will not be magnetic. \n \"However, sometimes \u2014 either spontaneously, or owing to an applied external magnetic field \u2014 each of the electron magnetic moments will be, on average, lined up. Then the material can produce a net total magnetic field, which can potentially be quite strong.\nThe magnetic behavior of a material depends on its structure ... and also on the temperature. At high temperatures, random thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to maintain alignment.\" \n Lenz's law deals with one particular bit about E fields inducing magnetic fields and vice versa.  If an E field causes a current to flow, which then creates a magnetic field, then that magnetic field induces current flow too...but in the  opposite  direction of the first one that created it.  If you think about it, it has to, otherwise things would just positively reinforce and we'd have free energy.  An electric current would create a magnetic field, and it would create more current, and that would create a bigger magnetic field, and all hell would break loose.", "Brushing helps to remove food particles and the bacterial film on your teeth.  But your mouth is still teeming with bacteria.  During the day, your saliva helps to keep them from multiplying too rapidly.

The goal was to create (or at least enable) AI by instantiating a set of rules to enable parsing and \"understanding\" of natural language.  I believe that after many years of effort, the attempt was either abandoned or vastly scaled back. \n It turns out that the task is  huge . Much of \"natural\" language interpretation relies on contextual cues, sometimes multiple contextual cues. To be able to understand what is meant by a phrase or sentence, it is often important to understand many other things about the world, society, physics, etc., not to mention the situation, the intent of the speaker, etc.   Trying to put those understandings in place created a requirement for ever growing areas of knowledge to also be instantiated. \n The researchers working on the project found that virtually every time they encountered a situation where contextual knowledge was needed and put it in place, it uncovered many more such areas. It was like peeling an onion, except every time you peeled off a layer, the underlying layer was larger. The task seemed to simply grow almost exponentially. \n I don't think that implies that the task was impossible, just that it was very difficult. Certainly humans have only a finite understanding of such things, but it is simply very large, complex, and interconnected.  We also rely on \"fuzzy\" logic systems and feedback loops that themselves may be chosen contextually, and may even be self-modifying. \n It might be easier to do such a thing today with the resources that have been developed such as Wikipedia, large data mining techniques, etc.  Certainly IBM's Watson has been able to be successful in certain areas. \n But as a result of this effort and others like it, most researchers decided that it simply doesn't make sense to try to create a huge body of information beforehand, but to instead rely more on a learning-based technique.", "I'm not sure I can explain without drawing pictures or timing diagrams, but I'll give it a shot. \n Let's say you've got a circuit with multiple inputs, and that circuit performs some logic and makes an output. It obviously makes sense to make sure that you don't count on the output being correct until after some elapsed time that you have guaranteed that all of the inputs are in the correct state. So we say that there's a required  set-up time ...the amount of time that the inputs must be correct prior to using the output to drive the next stage. \n Similarly, you know that those inputs aren't going to remain in their current states forever. At some point, they are going to change to new values and that could change the output of your circuit. The duration for which they must be guaranteed to be correct is the input  hold time . \n So now you've defined a period of time where the inputs are known to be correct. But your circuit takes a little time to change states, and it also takes some time for its output to get to the next stage downstream. And that next stage downstream can have signals coming as inputs to it that are either faster or slower than the output of your circuit. If the faster signals don't hold their output state long enough for the slower signals to get there, then you get incorrect behavior. \n The hold time of one circuit is inextricably tied to the setup time of the next circuit that it feeds.  And since each circuit's input can be fed from various other circuit's outputs with varying valid timings, the window of opportunity gets shorter and shorter as you have more stages in a circuit or more variation between the different signals. Eventually the window of opportunity goes to zero. \n This wouldn't happen if every signal had exactly the same switching speed and propagation delay. That's not true in reality, for several reasons. Transistors (tubes) vary, wires vary, and not every circuit gate has the same switching behavior due to its design. More importantly, some signal paths will go through fewer gates than others or take shorter routes, so they will arrive much faster than others. \n This problem can be mitigated by adding latches that hold signals at some state, only allowing them to change when a synchronous clock changes. (That also assumes that the clock arrives at all latches at the same time, which of course is untrue, so you have to account for the \"clock skew\" too.) \n Making a complex circuit work means juggling setup times and hold times and clock skew, so that every signal in a circuit is valid within the right window, even when you account for random variations in manufacturing Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT). When the topology of the circuit makes it impossible to juggle this, you change it or add delay elements (latches) or pipeline stages (kind of the same thing).   Every time you do that, you introduce a performance penalty of one sort or another. \n I suspect that there is virtually zero chance that a SB circuit design would work when changed from an integrated circuit to a tube design, even at slower clock frequencies. The setup time and hold times are dependent on the circuit netlist topology, the resulting physical topology, the propagation delays that result from that topology, and the speeds of the switching elements themselves.  If you change one of those things, you have to re-time the signals to verify that you don't need more latches or pipeline stages to be inserted. (You virtually can't have too many, except that they hurt performance.) \n I hope that helps, but I'm not sure it is any clearer. When you program a flash chip over a bus, all of the real timing stuff is several layers of protocol below what you are seeing. The timing numbers you are looking at are the sum of a whole bunch of chip signalling timings, with bus protocol timings on top of that, and OS protocol timings on top of that, and padding on top of that.", "You still sound slightly confused. I'll see if I can clarify further for you: \n >Both are isolators as the control circuit (gate) is electrically isolated from the power circuit, \n Actually, the gate in a MOSFET is not directly connected to the source or drain, but it isn't totally \"isolated\" either. There's a fair amount of capacitive coupling that can be very important for high frequency AC signals, particularly inside of an IC.  By itself, a MOSFET simply doesn't provide the quality of electrical signal isolation that an optoisolator can give.  They generally have high input impedances, but that alone does not make a high-quality isolator. \n Since the signal is converted to light and then back to an electrical signal in an optoisolator, there's virtually no capacitive coupling, and ground bounce can be better managed.  They truly isolate circuits. \n The ability of an optoisolator to provide protection from overvoltages is a different (but also useful) reason to use one.  There are other reasons too, such as level shifting between circuits with different supply voltages and/or signal ranges.  But they are generally used for isolation, hence their name. \n >and Opto as in using a magnetic field to control the power circuit \n In electrical engineering (and I think most of engineering and science), \"opto-\" refers specifically to light, not magnetic fields.

Couldn't get past the no editing of the video to enjoy any video play. \n And lastly we have another video where the poster links the video as \"Epic and funny moments #3 - Battlefield 3\"... now I haven't watched the video yet nor have I voted it. But if it doesn't have some epic and funny moments then it will get a downvote. People need to be truthful in their video links... don't hype for the sake of hype. I have to sort through the videos and if I feel I totally wasted my time and found the title misleading then I will reflect it with a vote. \n When I post a video I might throw the words \"watch if you have 15 minutes to waste\" or something to that effect. Then people will know it was their choice to click on it. Or simply state the facts of the video itself. I try to do that with the labeling of all my videos on my channel. People shouldn't click on my videos to expect one thing and get another.", "M16. \n The point of the slap is to ensure a proper quick release. And slapping the side of a weapon with the human hand is far from doing any damage to the weapon or mechanism. \n To use the fingers is not proper procedure with any rifle from what I am told. Only time such actions would be proper if trying to keep a low sound profile. \n Edit: note your comments on the L85A2 specifically. I have not noticed the animation for it in game. And I am not familiar with it's catch. (does it have a button switch instead?)", "Bad Company 2 had the VIP system where you could purchase the VIP and get access to new maps as they came out. Maps are considered game features not available to all. \n And each new DLC has in it specific weapons and maps that are not available to the normal player. And as we know BF3 includes DLC specific game modes even each DLC. Game modes (features) not available to the normal players. \n You can nit pick all you want but the difference in DLC and Premium is little more then semantics... with Premium just being a level up from DLC in the pecking order of feature content. And added purchase allowing for added features just as each DLC does. \n People seem to think Premium is not DLC... but it is. You download updates for it just as any other DLC. You get features with it just as any other DLC. \n And again... each of the DLC has new weapons that can be carried into the  entire expansion  of the multiplayer game experience, and dogtags available to be worn through out all gameplay too. \n We are not talking separate issues. Premium is a DLC. \n Premium does not offer a single new weapon or game mode with it. It does give you access to other DLC, but those themselves give you the added features they each offer. Whether it be maps, game modes, weapons, dogtags, etc.. \n Premium DLC itself gives you added features of a new skin for the knife (ACB-90). While other DLC give you complete new weapons with different capabilities to each. \n Premium DLC itself gives you dogtags and new camo to use in game. While other DLC give you dogtags and access to new vehicles to use in game! \n Premium DLC itself gives you 'QUEUE PRIORITY'... letting you jump in front of other players that are waiting to get into a full sever. (but still behind a normal VIP player) Whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo! I have taken advantage of this all of less then 20 times in nearly 6000 games. Oh... and it gives you access to Premium only servers? While other DLC give you access to specific game mode servers. Specific game map servers. Want to play Air Superiority...? Guess what... you need to have the End Game DLC to take advantage of this feature. \n Premium DLC itself gives you entire XP weekends. Once again... Whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo! So I get the points needed to what? Get unlocks quicker? Guess what you can buy DLC to unlock stuff instantly. Or rank...? I get to look like I am special with a cool Colonel 100 dogtag before most others? Damn I must really hate on those Dr Pepper dogag owners and other special dogtag offers? \n 2 weeks early access? So I should  really  hate the PS3 guys most then...? Because their normal players get access 2 weeks earlier the PC/Xbox 360 normal players. Are you really crying because others are getting something a little bit before you? Really?? You must really hate Japan for getting a lot of tech stuff before the rest of the world too?", "Nothing personal against the OP here... BUT (and this is a big BUT) NEVER EVER EVER download FREE Apps from untrusted sources. (even trusted sources can be dangerous at early release) \n The potential for something in that App to gather info from you or control a portion of your device is highly likely. Just saying... buyer beware applies especially to those who are getting something for FREE."]}, {"subreddit": "BF_Hardline", "posts": ["If small things (such as sights, or attachments) were incrementally given (instead of clumped together) then the slow (but constant) progression of unlocking things would feel more organic. \n And yet BF3 had for the most part an incremental progression of said small things and it too was populated with boosters not even playing the game just to achieve rank. \n Is it too much to say 100 kills with a weapon be had before all weapon attachments can be purchased?  (it isn't even that much in BFH)  Hardline basically took BF3 but gave you a choice at what you could purchase instead of having certain things unlock that you didn't even want. \n >Most people want to have [thing] and want to do it the fastest way possible. \n This I see but when many people aren't even playing the game and are sitting doing the most boring activities of farming of points... then the sense of achievement can't be the same from boosting to playing. \n I think it really does boil down to the fact of most players doing this really just have little patience at all to try and achieve a difficult task. Spoon fed gaming society that cares more about end game then the actual enjoyment of the hunt. Which is playing the game. \n Most amusing thing I see... is that it doesn't take long for people to start complaining that they ave nothing else to play for or strive to achieve because they are level 150 and maxed out in money and such. And yet for many... these people didn't even care to play the game properly to reach this level. They took the shortest route possible just to be done and then complain after doing so.", "Your entire post is basically highlighting this hatred of weapons camo. Get over it... as nothing to do with CoD players. As I am not one and don't mind them at all. Old Rainbow 6 games had actual player camo that was pink and off color... so not seeing it as a CoD issue. Maybe that is your own neurosis coming through? But  again  you knew this was going to stay in game before you bought it. \n Thanks for the link... I don't show the sticky that you claim is on the right hand side. It isn't on my reddit. Vast majority of those issues are minor. And some even I myself consider non-issues. I played the Beta and had no such belief that every issue would be fixed prior to launch. Just not feasible with the the amount of time from Beta to launch. \n Yes some of the issue like Emblem spray that wasn't prevalent in the Beta, but is now on many systems is frustrating. But not to the point I regret my purchase. But it will mean I simply won't purchase Premium until it is fixed. \n But what it really boils down to is that you are simply complaining on this sub-reddit and it is doing nothing to achieve a goal. If you are looking for moral support then you aren't going to find it by blaming CoD players for the issues. \n I myself have heard no kids voices as I did when playing BF3 except for when I was on the Australian servers. So that observation by  you too just falls on deaf ears.", "It is legit to use rep boosters. That is why they are in game isn't it? It is also legit to actually play as a team and request hacker to upgrade you. Put a mic on and find out how many people jump in to help you out. \n I have many times heard a player complain openly in game about losing his rep progress. I simply jump into hack without him requesting and started upgrading them. Then I hear the cheers instead of jeers. \n Hacking is a team oriented task. Syndicates assignments are not solo assignments... a Syndicate is representative of an organization of people... not Lone Wolf Mcquade. \n I myself never worried too much about it. Worried more in making sure others get their tier status before I even think of my own. Never pushing for anyone to assist in hacking really unless they wish to. But I did assist a guy get 8 tier 4 for his enforcer last night and then a few more tier 4 for some other class I don't recall, in same game? He in turn assisted me with my last tier 4s I needed for Mechanic Syndicate. But had he not assisted I simply would have continued playing and eventually gotten them via regular game play as I did my other tier 4s.", "What lead you to believe im 'hating on' (dumb ass term) anything? \n \"~edit- PC by the way, no-consoles in my house. ;)\" \n > I reeeeaaaaaaly dislike consoles, no doubt about it. Why does that offend you? \n Your actions are little different then walking into a room full of gamers... most of whom are console players strike up a conversation, and with no other reason exclaim \"~edit- PC by the way, no-consoles in my house. ;)\" while pointing to your little name tag that already says PC on it. \n > Can I not have pride in my \"team\" and brag about it, without your brain barf stinkin up the place? Put down the label gun, pick up some common sense. \n Sure... no issues in having pride. But just like Americans shouldn't be loud and obnoxious about our Patriotic zeal when in mixed company of global leaders... neither should PC gamers stink up the room with their needless  'Merica  type of attitude. And it appears you are the one that pulled out the label gun and wrote in big letters  \"~edit- PC by the way, no-consoles in my house. ;)\"  and did so as an after thought edit as if... 'hey I forgot to blurt out that I am gay and proud of it in the middle of a Mormon church service.' \n So keep crying about how I some how have offended you when you are the one that dropped the gauntlet with your edit. If you are going to be proud and yell it out then be ready for these exact types of confrontations. You have the freedom to say anything you want but I have the freedom to call you out on those words.", "And really it depends on your team, if they have any awareness whatsoever, and if the enemy team isn't going for your cameras... \n That says it all. You don't depend on the enemy  going for your cameras  or for your team to pay attention to the minimap for your cameras. That is simply incredulous. \n Though obviously your team does effect the outcome of your getting a camera coin because they need to get kills. But it is your responsibility to judge the map and choose where the action is most prevalent. \n No you are not going to be guaranteed to get a coin every single game. There are just going to be times you can't judge well where the action is going to be. But it really is easy enough to get a coin every other game. And some games are going to earn you multiple coins. \n It is your responsibility to ensure that your cameras are placed in the correct area, it is also your responsibility to ensure if they are removed that you replace them.  Not your teammates nor especially the enemy. \n Simple enough... if you aren't hearing the audible cue that your cameras are spotting enemies then you likely aren't placing them properly. If you are hearing the constant audible spotting cue but not getting intel assists then you aren't placing them where your team is actually actively engaging enemy."]}, {"subreddit": "darksouls", "posts": ["For better or worse Dark Souls is not your normal RPG. \n It is more accurate to call it an action adventure game with RPG elements. \n As RPG storytelling and NPC encounter plot leading has been put to the side more so to focus directly on the combat of the game. \n Allowing players to create their own story by giving them open Lore with spattered association to current game play environment.", "and I've seen a bunch of it streamed.

Dark souls is hard but fair. \n The butcher quote is from 'Walking Dead' series. Basically about a bunch of people who tried to live the good values and welcoming people into their post apocalyptic refuge. Only to be over ran by the very same people they offered shelter to and treated like cattle. \n They eventually took back their refuge from their attackers and became butchers in their own right. Now instead of welcoming people in for refuge they led them into their death like cattle, the way they were treated by previous usurpers. \n Only to lead the wrong group of people into their butcher shop and eventually surcame to their own butchering by a group who professed a more virtuous path that they once held. \n Dark Souls is no more fair in one aspect then another. It gives you a small 10 minute window of chance to run from bonfire to fog door to evade a second chance encounter with Invaders. Or summon assistance in hopes that the two of you can prevail over the Invading hordes? But little different then the chances they give with Bosses where you are locked in battle with a creature that often can just out class you until you can level up. \n If a person wishes to play the evil role then FROM gave them that opportunity. If you want to play the savior role then they equally give you that option too. So you can yell and rant all you want but it doesn't change the butchers from what they are... you have to become the butchers, kill the butchers or become the cattle.

If it is an item not found in game and is modded in then it is not a twink... it would be something in the lines of a hack. \n Get over it... you got beat.

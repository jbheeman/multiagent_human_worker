But... I can't tell if she's gay or not. I added her on Facebook and she has several pictures of herself with another girl. They only have their arms around each other in a friendly way, so I can't tell if they're dating or just best friends or whatever. But there's such a sheer number of pictures together that it makes me suspicious. There's no \"relationship status\" on her facebook either. \n I guess my problem stems from not being able to judge if she's interested in me or not. As far as I remember, she's never mentioned having a girlfriend or anything and she seems interested enough. But maybe she's just being nice to me. Any way to sneakily figure out if she's gay or not? Thanks!"]}, {"subreddit": "BreakUps", "posts": ["We (20M/18F) dated for three years. She just broke up with me tonight after a few days of a \"break\" and the incoming breakup looking obvious. I love her but she says she doesn't love me in the same way and can't see a future together anymore. \n I'm devastated. She not only was my girlfriend, but my best friend as well. I want to remain friends, but when we talk now our conversations are flat and empty when they were once full of laughter and energy. It's hard to see a friendship between us that's even close to what it used to be. She had the ability to make me completely drop my inhibitions and have fun with her like no one else I've ever met. I'm normally shy and reserved but with her I always was completely open and always had the time of my life. It's hard to imagine ever finding a friend like her again. \n Right now I feel aimless and depressed. I'm not sure where to go with my life now, and what to do next. A big part of my life is now gone, and it's hard to imagine finding someone like her again. I feel destroyed."]}, {"subreddit": "relationships", "posts": ["I sound so stupid when I type this out. I've been in a long-distance relationship with a girl for almost three years. She's 18 now and I'm 20/M. For the last few months I've been feeling like we've been drifting apart somewhat. For example, our conversations have become less involved/fun and she doesn't seem as excited to see me anymore. She just seemed to have checked out from the relationship. \n On top of that, I found out that a few months ago she developed a crush on a guy that she worked with. I know that I wouldn't be nearly as bothered by this if she hadn't kept it from me and then lied when I asked her about it. She eventually admitted it when I saw she had googled advice on having crushes while in a relationship. Again, I would have been so much less bothered if she had just talked to me about it. \n It all came to a head last night, when I asked if she would like me to book a trip to see her over Christmas. I was about to book a flight when I saw her grimacing and looking uneasy. I asked her what was wrong, and after some probing she said she felt uneasy about me coming to see her for some reason. A couple of trips ago she had actually cried the first day I came to see her. At the time she said she didn't know why she was crying, but last night she said it was the same feeling. \n We talked, or rather she did at me while I sat in pain and silence, and she wondered out loud if we should break up. No real decision was made until today, when she said that she wanted to take a break from the relationship for an unknown amount of time. I don't want that at all, but I said nothing besides that I thought we could work things out. \n Anyways, I think I'm typing this out more for myself than anything. my question, I suppose, is if breaks in a relationship ever work out? This is my first lasting relationship and I feel like I really love her. I don't feel like this relationship will last once a break like this has been taken. Even if we do get back together, I feel like I will always remember this in the back of my mind and it will eat at me. I don't want us to break up because I do love her, and she's really special to me. But I don't really feel confident anymore. It's hard to imagine moving on to a different girl after her."]}]}

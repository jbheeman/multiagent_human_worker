I don't have any, but my friends who do have always assured me that 'it's just different when it's your kid.'  And I've never had a problem taking care of younger siblings/nieces/nephews, etc.  But I also think that the landscape shifts a lot as the kids age, and there are some real pitfalls that can come with trying to raise a family when you (and probably some of the kids, as well) have ADHD. \n I have ADHD, as does my mother.  I was undiagnosed until I was in college, and she was diagnosed a few years after that.  I wouldn't say that my mother was  bad , but if I'm being honest, there were definitely drawbacks in our household that, I think, are probably largely a result of her ADHD and/or her chronic depression. \n On the plus side, she took good care of us, especially when we were very young.  We were well fed and decently clothed.  We had a bedtime.  We were raised with good manners.  She read to us, and was a stay-at-home mom when we were little, so she did a lot of pre-school work with us; my sister and I could both read before we started kindergarten.  I never felt like she begrudged doing these things. \n On the down side, our house was extremely chaotic: always a mess (way beyond just everyday clutter), things being lost/misplaced all the time, constant arguments about unpaid bills, etc.  I can't blame this all on my mom; my dad was, at that time, too self-centered to pick up any of the slack, and was also drunk a lot.  But it definitely had an impact.  By the time I was around 8 (I'm the oldest), I had to start doing the bulk of the chores around the house.  I got dinner started after school, fed our animals (we had a small hobby farm), did laundry, washed dishes, and was expected to do a lot of other cleaning/picking up around the house.  Back then (mid-late '80s) this sort of thing was more expected of 'latch-key kids' anyway, but I'm sure she was glad of a chance to shift the responsibility onto us instead.  Of course, I never got around to doing most of the chores, which just added to the tension in the house (dad was mad about the mess, my sister felt I wasn't doing my fair share). \n Of course, that brings us to the fact that mom had to deal with  my  ADHD as well.  Although it was suggested as early as 3rd grade that I might have a problem, my parents (i.e. my dad) didn't believe there was anything wrong with me, blah, blah, blah.  The usual story.  So there wasn't any official help for me, but I was also completely missing any real structure at home.  There was no one to teach me to manage my time, or organise myself, and no one to consistently check up on me to make sure I was doing homework (in between the hours of chores), etc.  My mom wasn't (and still isn't, really) capable of that level of organisation herself.  Which increased stress in our family, which made it all worse...it was really a vicious cycle, that inevitably ended in divorce (though, since my mom came out as a lesbian a few years after the fact, I suppose it really  was  only a matter of time). \n So, that story ended up far longer than I intended.  I guess my point is that you may find it fairly easy while your kids are very young, and their needs are basic and fairly instinctual.  But as they get older, particularly if one or both of them have ADHD as well, you may find that you struggle to provide the structure that they need in order to succeed.  That's not to say you shouldn't have kids, or that it'll be a disaster, or anything like that.  When and if you do find that you're having problems, please know that there are a lot of resources-- books, support groups, coaches, workshops-- that can help.

She can also have you take a variety of 'exams' designed to test things like impulsiveness and attention span, and compare your results to the norm. \n By combining all of these factors, a doctor or psychologist can make a determination that yes, your patterns of behaviour and executive function fit what we've defined as ADHD. \n Some people might argue that, since it's not a definitive, 'yup, the strip turned green, you've got it' sort of disorder, that it's not a 'real' thing.  But you should remind those people that there are a hell of a lot of medical diseases and disorders that don't have that sort of test either.  Medical doctors use differential diagnosis to find things like lupus, PCOS, and any number of other diseases that don't present in a cut-and-dried manner.", "I think there have always been people who emphasize what they see as the positives of ADHD (i.e. creative thinking, hyper-focus, etc.).  There have also been those who look at the downsides of ADHD and prefer to characterize those as institutional/societal problems, rather than there being anything wrong with the individual (i.e. people aren't meant to live according to an academic schedule). \n And while I can understand, and even appreciate, those points of view, the problem is that, as far as I can tell, in an effort to sell a lot of books, this guy's cooked up this \"Indigo Children\" theory to make every kid with ADHD seem like a special little genius who's all misunderstood and repressed by society and its screwed-up values. \n And hey...maybe they're right.  But guess what?  Society and its values aren't changing any time soon.  So if they don't help their kid adapt, then they're setting the kid up for failure.

I'm not saying that's ok; results matter, and if they're failing the public, we should hold them accountable. \n But what I  am  saying is that their ideals matter too, regardless of actual outcomes.

I'm sure most people like them just fine, and if they've never had the other sort, they'll never know there's a difference.  But for people who  do  know better, it's a little bit odd.

Often, they kept the survivors as slaves, or sold them on.  But, then again, they also had their own, native-born slaves, just as most cultures of that age had some kind of indentured underclass.  Sometimes, they'd keep people's land, as well, and bring in their own families, and settle it. \n And the thing is, if the situation were reversed-- if some other group attacked them (or, at least, mounted a defense), killed them, stole their shit, or sold them into slavery-- well, fair play.  And when they did settle in a place, they more-or-less integrated with the other locals (and within a few generations had become, for example, the Normans). \n The KKK, on the other hand, are and always have been a bunch of cowards.  They sit around in their clubhouse, stroking each others egos about how superior they are, just because they're white Christians, then put on their hoods and go out and sneak around, trying to scare anyone who isn't.  They burn, and smash, and vandalise-- but only when they think they won't get caught, or won't be prosecuted.  They beat and murdered people, as long as there was no danger of those people being able to fight back or retaliate; if the victim escaped, the police wouldn't help, and if the victim managed to injure one of the 'knights', then a jury of 'peers' would finish the Klan's job.  They continued to do this long after the rest of Western society decided that it was wrong. \n And they've kept it up, generation after generation, entirely because they  don't  want anyone to integrate; they think there's something magical about being a white Christian (preferably Protestant) that makes them better than anyone else, and they think they should enjoy a privileged place in society because of it.", "Look at it from a purely logistical standpoint: \n The Highland council area is roughly the same size, geographically, as the entire State of Massachusetts.  Massachusetts is divided into  over 300  local municipalities, because, apart from anything else, it would be ridiculous to expect administrators in Boston to oversee things like trash collection or snow removal in Pittsfield.  It simply makes more sense for many of these services to handled on a distributed, local level. \n I'm sure it's similar in Canada.  Manitoba, for example, is divided into over 130 urban & rural municipalities.  According to Wikipedia, the largest, by area, is Reynolds, at 3,574 km^2 .  It's mostly Provincial Forest, with 14 unincorporated villages.  Compare that to the Highland Council area, at 26,119 km^2 , with at least 65 different towns & villages.

If they drag their heels, he can go 4 miles down the road, to the town hall, for the next board meeting, and complain a little more. \n If  I  want a pothole fixed, I'm free to complain to one of my local councillors next time I see him in the co-op, but then, even if he gives a shit, he's got to try to convince some administrator in Stornoway that it needs fixed.  And if they're oddly reluctant to prioritise a road 4 hours away, on another island, in a village they probably couldn't point to on a map, then what are my options?  Even if there's an open council meeting, am I going to take an entire day-- or 2, more likely-- to travel up there?

And I was the only CS major (or maybe even the only engineer - never bothered to find out) on my floor. So that blew. In fact, it blew so hard that my roommate moved out halfway through the year because we were so incompatible (but not before at one point kicking me out of the room at 2am to have inebriated intimate relations). I also didn't have any real friends until late into first semester (due to the stupid random placement and taking general courses instead of major courses), so that definitely took a toll on me and made me even more jaded than I was before. (Tbh, I was expecting college to be full of cool techy people who would be awesome to hang around, and was really disappointed to find it was just the same social atmosphere as HS but turned up to 11 and fueled by alcohol.) \n Then second semester I got the double all to myself, and I finally started taking major-specific courses and met a bunch of cool people (that also happened to all have I T  personalities - go figure!).

Being pretty involved in the PC gaming community at my college (as an organizer and representative as well as a participant), this is pretty much the response I get from any girl who shows enough interest in the pastime for me to suggest she attend one of our events. It's a stupid self-reinforcing stereotype: no females attend events -> \"forever alone scent\" -> new females do not want to participate -> ...  It's a pain in the ass for the hobby in general and for our clubs in particular. This is also why \"meet a nice girl, teach her to play Starcraft\" is a tall order: there is this stigma around PC gaming, and I've been blown off by both guys and girls a large number of times at \"general\" social events when I mentioned it to any extent, even otherwise \"geeky\" people (in the veins of \"Oh, you're one of  those  people.

It's definitely there, but I'd put it as a subclass of the \"leet over noob\" thing coupled with the fact that there are so few women. Since the typical woman does not play games, a woman that does is stereotyped as a \"noob\" (because \"she's a woman! she doesn't  really  play games!!1!\") and therefore lower. Besides, the whole reason it (or at least the more competitive parts of it) emphasizes hierarchy is because it's just another sportlike activity of free-flowing testosterone and male dominance instincts (at least for some - there's actually an interesting dichotomy that arises between people who play for fun and people who play to win, and that is the cause of much rage in team-based competitive games). Couple that with the fact that the males pursuing these activities are typically not exactly the alpha type irl, and the anonymity aspect, and you've got yourself a pretty good model of the human animal in the wild. \n However, this is only half (probably less than half) of the reason for the amount of misogyny you typically see. The other half is the simple fact that there are very few women who game \"seriously\" (ESA stats are BS in this regard because they consider games like farmville and angry birds equally with e.g. Starcraft - the actual ratio is more like 1:8-1:10), and they attract attention just because they're different. Any desirable outlier is going to cause ripples, and adding a generous helping of testosterone does not help things. So then you get all the males trying to assert dominance and show off: the misogynists and \"white knights\" are really two sides of the same hormone-fueled coin. Plus, there's no common social rules for dealing with gender differences in games, and many (male) gamers simply don't know how to deal with the opposite gender (again, due to lack of experience/exposure). So it's not actually as much of a \"man over woman\" thing as it is men competing for women - even if they aren't consciously aware of it - and having no social code for inter-gender interaction. \n And then you've got people like me who feel dirty getting involved in this and instead writing massive posts on the internet re: this is why we can't have nice things (i.e. not be foreveralone)."], "anchor_demographics": {"age": 20, "gender": "male", "occupation": "computer science student (AI/Game design)", "location": "United States"}, "shift_vector": {"POWER": 0.83, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.42, "HEDONISM": 0.18, "STIMULATION": 0.55, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.48, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.21, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.3, "TRADITION": 0.09, "CONFORMITY": 0.12, "SECURITY": 0.92}, "target_vector": {"POWER": 0.83, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.42, "HEDONISM": 0.18, "STIMULATION": 0.55, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.48, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.21, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.3, "TRADITION": 0.09, "CONFORMITY": 0.12, "SECURITY": 0.92}}

Those entire two sentences sound like a 3-year-old's tantrum thrown re:I don't have what I want without actually knowing what he wants. \n >your entire life will not leave a lasting impression \n Yeah, if you spend your entire life sitting on your ass moping about how nobody likes you and nobody understands you, the only legacy you will leave is all the tax dollars going into your welfare checks instead of useful stuff like education or NASA. Get up and do shit! You have to want to leave an impression and work your ass of for it to actually do it. \n >you will die alone \n Unless you join one of those mass suicide cults! Oooooh that sounds like  fun !", "O hi! \n You helped me out with a self esteem boost a while back, so I'll try my best to return the favor... \n Yep, you pretty much are going through the same ideas as at least some of the people here; at least I can see some points that I've thought about myself. Which bring up an interesting point - I'm starting to think FA is a completely gender-neutral situation. (I'll explain a bit further down.) \n First about you wanting to be male: the grass is always greener on the other side. I can't say \"oh it's so much easier to find an SO if you're a girl\" etc without being a hypocrite, but I've thought a number of times about how much easier finding an SO would be for me personally if I was a female. I have some very good online and semi-online friends (all male, of course) whose interests I share and company I greatly enjoy, so if I was a female they'd all be great interest-based relationship potential (I'm taking a risk putting this here because most of them are redditors, and if they read this, the gay jokes will never stop). \n I see where  you're coming from with saying that getting an SO is easier as a guy - guys have more room to maneuver because they're expected to make the first move and be proactive about relationships. E.g., all of the Seddit and other \"change yourself\" advice that's out there is aimed primarily at men. It's like for guys it's \"be confident, hit the gym, go to bars, approach, rapport or w/e\" etc etc etc while for girls it's just \"be pretty, put out.\" \n However, at least to me, this \"change yourself\" stuff is just another form of lying about yourself. Sure, I can go read seddit, practice, work out, then go to a bar to pick up chicks and possibly get laid. But that won't change what my interests, worldviews, pastimes etc are (and even of they did, I wouldn't really like to become an alcoholic douchebag!) So essentially I'd just be putting on a front of something I am not, and it will only attract people that I wouldn't want to be around in the first place. Will I get a rewarding and/or lasting relationship if I follow that route? NO. \n I feel like the best advice I can give to anyone in this position is to just be yourself, and work from that. Tell your interests like they are and be honest about yourself, and you'll find yourself surrounded by (perhaps only a few) people that share your interests and whose company you actually enjoy. Same goes for dating websites and meeting new people. Yeah I only talk about programming and video games, and don't drink or party; if someone finds that boring or weird then our business is done and and a lot of time is saved both for them and for me. \n And this brings me to the point I mentioned earlier: I am starting to believe, in part because of what I see on this subreddit, in part because of my own experience moving around (new high school, moving to college, etc), that FA is an interest-based condition. People start out with less-sociable interests (especially computer-related ones - oh, lordy), which leads to acquiring less practice with general socialization (e.g. icebreakers, small talk, etc) while at the same time not giving enough environments to interact with like-minded people. So what happens is exactly what you said - by college, all the nerdy kids just keep to themselves and don't come out of their hideyholes at all, for the same reason you (and I) don't - the ratio of awesome people to party douches among people who go out is, well, abysmal to say the least. We have the internet (that's why we're here! Huzzah!), but as far as IRL interaction goes, finding other people with non-sociable interests is hard as all hell. \n However, it is not impossible, as I found out through experience this past year in college. Yeah, it took me 6 months to finally establish a group of 3-4 friends I could occasionally hang out with, and I met all of them through classes. However, they are all awesome people who share my interests and who I enjoy spending time with, despite my natural reclusiveness. I also created an environment in which people with my interests could coalesce by organizing small, unofficial LAN parties which amounted to people showing up to a computer lab, installing some games and playing them for an evening. It started out with 4 people; at the end of the semester, we had 12. (Addendum: on a campus of 20,000.) Also, someone at my college organized an online LoL event at one point, and so many people turned up (via facebook) that they decided to reserve a lecture hall and do it live (I believe it was around 50-60 people). The reason I'm mentioning this is to show that it's a boatload of effort to bring reclusive people together, but it's not hopeless, and with the internet it gets just a little bit easier. Another point, more directly related to your post: don't join a club, start one. Don't be complacent with your interests not being represented. (/inspirational speech) \n One last point about caring (I have to get up for work at 8:30 tomorrow X_X) - you do care, otherwise you wouldn't worry about it so much. But in fact, not caring may be the best option, because then you can be proud of who you are instead of thinking something is wrong with you because you have different interests than the majority of people. You forget that you're sad when you play games and browse reddit? Great, that means these are things you enjoy and find interesting! Do more of them and try to find people that will do them with you instead of trying to \"fit in\" and whatnot. (I know, I've failed you here because I don't play LoL, but if you PM/Steam message me I can point you to the Terraria server that I run with my friends and maybe you can help with our depopulation problem ;) ). \n Final thought and", "The animal is the result of billions of years of evolution, designed to make sure an individual survives and reproduces. It's always there, because, well, we're biological creatures and are built on the same foundations as all other biological creatures. What we  can  do as humans, though, is control and steer our instincts in a direction desirable to us as sentient beings. Alcohol, as well as certain other substances (not  all  mind-altering substances) take away this ability, putting the consumer at the complete mercy of their instincts. This doesn't mean sober people are in complete control of their instincts until they drink, but at least they have the  opportunity  to be in control. \n Why do people choose to indulge in mind-altering substances? Well, because it's pleasurable. And by \"pleasurable,\" I mean it mimics, releases, or blocks the reuptake of some of a couple dozen of neurotransmitters that activate the pleasure centers of the limbic system and amygdala. On a higher level than biochemistry, most people are well content to \"live in the moment\" and not really put much effort into controlling their instincts, because no one around them is doing so and they see no value in it (since they derive no pleasure from it, and pleasue, at least on the animal level, is the only real measure of utility for an action). \n After all, our culture encourages us to regress to our animal states. For example, it associates fun with releasing control. Sure, this produces the highest spikes of pleasure chemicals; it's a lot easier than deriving fun/pleasure from thinking and intellectual pursuits, and most people are all too happy (heh) to settle. Our culture also paints some of the most basic and instinctive behaviors and emotions - such as sex/romance, aggression, fear, etc - as being \"what makes us human,\" while painting rationality, logic, self-control and critical thinking - the traits of a sentient mind - as something cold, remote, and essentially  in human. \n As for the planet being run by animals - it's basically true. Large-scale sociopolitical structures are based on greed, tribal instincts, and hierarchical structures that have been around since before humans even differentiated from the other apes. This is why things like communism, which is actually a  fantastic  economic system, never work - instinct inevitably takes over (whether it's freeloading, or the powerful oppressing the weak, or what have you). It's also why we can't have a unified global government - individual leaders' lust for power and tribal aversion to strangers keep the planet and its resources divided."], "anchor_demographics": {"age": 20, "gender": "male", "occupation": "computer science student (AI/Game design)", "location": "United States"}, "shift_vector": {"POWER": 0.12, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.81, "HEDONISM": 0.19, "STIMULATION": 0.73, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.86, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.18, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.27, "TRADITION": 0.09, "CONFORMITY": 0.15, "SECURITY": 0.11}, "target_vector": {"POWER": 0.12, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.81, "HEDONISM": 0.19, "STIMULATION": 0.73, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.86, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.18, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.27, "TRADITION": 0.09, "CONFORMITY": 0.15, "SECURITY": 0.11}}

I've had a professor once, who was giving a lecture and related this story. \n He was walking in town with a friend one day, when he started to feel lightheaded, followed by feelings of elation and joy. He began seeing a light, and by the time he was travelling skywards through a bright tunnel, he was already lying on the ground and had lost consciousness. \n He was lucky. The friend he was walking with was a paramedic who didn't hesitate to call an ambulance and was proficient in providing first aid. The diagnosis in hospital: Pneumonia. This was one of the rare cases, where it had manifested without fever or pain in the chest. Part of his lungs had filled with fluid, so he didn't get the full amount of oxygen. This lack became critical when he was taking a walk, and he collapsed. \n So what about this experience? What about the joy he felt when he was floating up through a tunnel of light? Was that a religious experience? \n This professor lectured on neuroscience. So for him, as real as the sensations and the feelings he experienced were, he didn't see them as religious: For him it was his brain reacting to a lack of oxygen, going into emergency mode, while for someone else it might have been a glimpse of heaven. \n No matter what the experience, someone who doesn't believe, will not interpret it as a religious experience: no matter if Papa Legba has opened the door in a Vodou ceremony, the Holy Ghost has come over you in a Catholic cathedral, or Jesus has saved you in a Protestant church.", "It's worth having a look at why New Atheism at times looks like a mirror match: The whole movement only exists because of fundamentalist Christianity. \n I repeat: Without fundamentalist Christianity, there would be no New Atheism. It was the fight to get creationism into / out of the US public school system, which served as a wake-up call for the science establishment. \n Not only that. Scientists were not equipped to dealing with the kind of attacks that started to happen in tandem with the \"controversy\" around evolution: An invitation to public debate by a creationist rhetor, would more often than not end with the scientist utterly defeated. Not because of a lack of facts, or a lack of arguments, but because of superior use of rhetoric: One side was used to standing before a crowd of average Joes and delivering sermons with gut level appeal. The other side was used to teaching students. \n That was the climate in which New Atheism was born, out of a direct pissing contest with fundamentalist Christianity. New Atheism learnt the tricks of its trade in this context and from its adversaries. No wonder, it sometimes looks a tad similar to the fundamentalists.", "As mentioned, if you want to define New Atheism as Outspoken Atheism, then there is indeed nothing new about it. \n >You're simply creating a new strawman argument, as if it were some kind of disease or invasive species, that needs to be dealt with. It's nothing of the sort \n I don't think that many people want to create a disease called New Atheism. Most just want a name for what they see happening: \"How come that there are is so much fuss about atheism lately?\" \"Oh, it's because of those New Atheism fellows\" \n From the New Atheists came the proposition to label themselves \"Brights\". So even the people themselves have recognized that there is a need for a name. It's just that their name didn't stick, while New Atheism did. \n Maybe the movement was always there, as you say, but apparently it was just not as popular in years prior to the rise of fundamentalist insanity. Then maybe that is what New Atheism describes: A surge of popularity and media exposure for atheism which it didn't have in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Whatever it is exactly the term New Atheism points to, the term is here to stay, for better or worse. \n Thank you for your quotes by the way. They were fun, but didn't really do justice to your point that nothing has changed. I am, for example, not aware that Einstein used Physics in support of an atheist point of view, the way Dawkins uses evolution in support of an informed atheism. I also would tend to doubt that Ingersoll dared to venture too deeply into \"creation arguments\", drawing on modern cosmology to support his case for a secular worldview. Such things were uncommon. \n Before New Atheism, the motto for the relationship between science and religion was: \"Keep your religion out of my science! They are two different things and have nothing to do with each other. If we want to talk about religion, we will do so on the neutral battleground of Philosophy\" \n Now it is: \"Let's not be afraid to do some science to religion! We can look at religion as a natural phenomenon (title of a book by Dennett) in a systematic way, and we will do just that. And then hurl facts into your faces!\" That shift in attitude is the new point in New Atheism. Before, the investigation of religion was deeply rooted in the humanities and textual criticism (with some psychology nibbling at the corners, with limited success and exposure).

So yes, there also is no place for God in scientific theories which describe the beginning of the universe. \n A scientific theory is an extrapolation of what we observe: the expansion of the universe, the cosmic infrared background, light from faraway stars etc. etc. Those are the things that inform our current scientific theories about the origin of the universe. \n If you now say things to the effect of: \"But those theories which leave God out are not rational!\", that will earn you nothing more than a shrug. You are free to include God in your theory about the creation of the universe. Nobody says you can't.

{"user_id": "Wollff", "subreddit": "philosophy", "posts": ["Since that point sometimes seems to bring up confusion across the Atlantic, as someone from a concerned country, I will try to explain. There are historical reasons why Nazism became a crime in some European countries, and there are reasons why it still remains one. \n After WWII, Germany had a bit of a problem. Admittedly, it had more than one problem. But among short food supplies, and an infrastructure that consisted mainly of rubble and craters loomed the question: What do we do with all the leftover Nazis? \n The leading brass, the war criminals and mass murderers, went to N\u00fcrnberg. They were not a problem. But they were only the tip of a big Nazi iceberg. You had several levels of administration in all fields that had been part of the regime, been associated with the Nazi party, and had been functioning as well oiled cogs in the Reich. \n And beyond that, in the totalitarian state that was Nazi Germany, nearly everyone had collaborated with the regime in some way, often more out of fear, necessity, or for career advancement, than because of a belief in Nazi ideals. Imprison every collaborator, and you would have had to imprison everyone. \n Who was how much of a Nazi was a pretty hard question to answer. This was complicated further; as my grandmother put it: \"When the Allies came, there had never been any Nazis, only resistance fighters who cleverly had pretended to be Nazis\" \n Long story short: Instead of cleaning up the Nazi mess, purging, imprisoning, and investigating, Nazism was made illegal  from now on . With that the problem was considered solved. Nazis remained in high positions everywhere in Germany and Austria, they just couldn't make their views public. Since nobody wanted to talk about the war, remember the war, or stir up any trouble, that was seen as a good solution (until the late 60s). \n That's how the criminalization of Nazism came to be. So why is it still there? \n Because currently there are few good arguments for abolishing it. The only good reason is referring to the basic principle \"freedom of speech\": \"Everyone simply should be allowed to express his opinion\" \n But Nazism has left its mark in some European legal systems (and European thought) here. Many people here don't subscribe to freedom of speech the same way Americans do. A more (central) European definition of freedom of speech would be: \"Everyone should be allowed to express his opinion, unless he does it in a way that disturbs public peace, by degradation or defamation of a group\" \n Many people here agree that freedom of speech should end when you become literally Hitler. \"We don't want it. We don't need it. It doesn't contribute anything useful. It can be damned dangerous. Let's keep it illegal.\" \n There is also a political dimension: The people who want to abolish those laws, are almost exclusively on the far right. Usually they don't particularly care about freedom of speech, unless in this special case where they are hindered in what they want to say. \n And those who do care about freedom of speech, and are subsequently not on the far right, generally don't dare to touch those laws, since they might be labelled as Nazi sympathizers...", "It wasn't supposed to be some dick measuring contest, with me pulling down my pants and slapping [1] /r/atheism in the face with my penis. It is supposed to be poking fun at some of their reasoning and logical skills. \n So we are just poking fun at other people's reasoning and logic skills? Great. \n I mean, if they say dumb things, they deserve it. I fully agree. \n Let's take a look and see if what those atheists say is dumb: There is a guy in uniform that believes no loving God would ever allow the horrors he witnessed on a battlefield. \n You juxtapose that with Leibnitz and that irks me to no end: First that builds a strawman, since nobody claims to have solved the problem of evil once and for all. \n Second it deningrates a perfectly sound solution to the problem of evil: There is no God. Say what you will, but that works. Sure, there are other solutions. But the one he choose certainly isn't a dumb one, which can be dismissed by casually flicking out a Leibnitz. \n Third: It gives the impression that the person in question obviously doesn't know about Leibnitz, when he very well may be aware of him and still hold exactly that position. Voltaire was very well aware of Leibnitz, for example. After all he explicitly flipped him the bird with Candide, exclaiming hat Leibnitz must indeed have been very high when formulating the best of all possible worlds. \n >Nowhere am I being \"hateful\" or super antagonistic. \n You are right. I don't think you are being hateful. You are just poking fun at other people's logic and reasoning skills. \n Only problem is that you are arguably less logical and reasonable about it than some of the positions you try to make fun of. \n >I'm merely doing what they do. \n Exactly, such half baked attempts at deriding perfectly fine philosophical positions also happen in /r/atheism. That's why /r/philosophy doesn't like it. And it's a really good reason for not liking that sub. \n So why exactly should we do the same thing around here now?", "Your question is strange. \n Would you prefer your ice cream with gravy or barbecue sauce? \n The most probable answer: Neither. There are so many possible alternatives that are better than this arbitrary and artificial choice. \n And even if I am forced to choose between gravy and barbecue sauce with my ice cream, that answer doesn't say much about my preferences for either of the two in their usual context. \n Same with this question: Why does my society have to be a regime instead of an order, a foundation, a company, a club? Why does it have to be totalitarian? And why does freedom of expression have to go out of the window? \n All those constraints are arbitrary. I admit, such things can still lead to interesting thought experiments. But only if they manage to portray a consistent scenario. I don't see that here. \n Can you even have a regime that is deeply rooted in the search of knowledge but doesn't allow for freedom of expression? Maybe you can have it, but it's hard to imagine. \n You are required to search for knowledge that will benefit mankind, but if you find it, you might not be allowed to tell anyone about it?

{"user_id": "Wollff", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "posts": ["How exactly do negatives help a person get better at pullups? \n It is pretty intuitive, I think: How does training work? The one term that describes it best is progressive overload: You put more load on your muscle than it is usually required to handle. Which leads to adaptation. \n An unusual load can either mean unusually high weight, or unusually high reps (or, as bw people know, unusual patterns of movements). It is the magic combination of weight and volume that defines all types of training and defines where the adaptive response of your muscle goes. \n Now for negatives. There are two uses for negatives: Either you start doing them for an exercise after you finished your reps and can't do the full exercise anymore. Or you start doing them when an exercise is so hard you can't even manage a positive rep. \n That's a great tactic. Because suddenly you can put your muscle under the same weight you would like it to adapt towards, for the full range of motion you would like to achieve, for more reps than were possible with only positive movement. In short, negatives enable you to train with  supermaximal volume . \n It's similar for the heavy exercises when you can't even manage a single rep: With a negative you train the same muscles, over the same range of motion as the full movement, with a load that is actually too heavy for you. Negatives enable you to train with  supermaximal weight .", "When thinking about routines I always think about planes. No. Not flying. Geometry. I want movement in the horizontal and vertical plane.

One single exercise. The handstand. Vertical pushing exercise which can be done without equipment, with a load of variations with bent as well as straight arms (handstand push ups, HS press variations) which are limited primarily by upper body vertical pushing-strength. \n As far as I know, there is  nothing  else in bwf which fulfills those criteria.", "Okay, this is interesting. So you have a specific bodybuilding goal. That would be \"The Bruce Lee Physique\" (TBLP). Along with that comes the first thing we need to be clear about: This is bodybuilding you want to do. So what specific exercises you will be doing is, first of all,  secondary . \n TBLP is where you want to go. In order to find out how to get where you want to go, you need to know where you are. Only then can the way become clear. \n Enough East Asian sounding bullshit: In order to reach a goal, you need to know some parameters which define your goal. A rough sketch is fine in the beginning. So what defines TBLP? \n First of all those are pretty basic things: Weight, height, and body fat will generally define your looks. If you have the right weight, at the right height, with the right amount of body fat, you will not be Bruce Lee, but you will already be pretty close to TBLP. \n Since height is a factor you can't manipulate (sorry), you will have to concentrate on weight and bf%. Since TBLP is defined by being a rather small guy at a very light weight, with a really low bf%, getting to TBLP will probably involve cutting, and a lot of it. \"I need to gain some weight, in order to look like Bruce Lee\", is a sentence rarely heard... \n That means you will be manipulating your diet in a skillful way, so that you can train, maintain muscle and strength, while losing weight and fat in order to come close to TBLP. \n So this is the first thing I would suggest: Get an estimate of the weight you will have to aim for, in order to have TBLP at your height. Then make a plan on how you can get to that weight, without losing muscle. There are many specific methods to do this, but if you want a surefire way, having a look at the anal retentive way in which /r/leangains goes about controlling their diet will surely help (have fun with weighing everything you eat, and calculating its macronutrient content! Hey, nobody said getting TBLP was easy!). \n That's it. We are done. \n Oh, you wanted to talk about training? Let me answer that in the form of a captain hindsight meme: If you wanted me to talk about training, you should have come here with a strength goal. \n Thing is that you will probably have to modify your body quite a bit before you are close to the basic parameters of TBLP. Right now it's probably too early for the specific crafting of certrain parts of your physique in order to get that perfect TBLP. You can still do that once you are close to an appropriate weight and close to an appropriate amount of bf. \n So first of all it will be the basic bodyweightfitness routine from the faq. \"But why this routine? It has nothing to do with Bruce Lee!\", you ask. Well, because in order to get TBLP the way Bruce Lee got TBLP would involve living quite a bit like Bruce Lee for a pretty long time, which, sadly, is impossible for most of us. Most of us can't handle the amount of training he did. Or the type of training he did. Basically anything he did.", "So should I rest and keep my training method even though I don't feel sore the next day? \n Yes. Three times 8 to 12 is the upper limit oft the hypertrophy range, so you should be fine. Soreness doesn't say much after all: when training the same movements regularly soreness will decrease, while you are still makingmaking good progress. \n Why? Simple. Because there are several factors which make muscles grow. Among them are hormonal responses, reactions to diverse metabolic products, and muscular damage. What you feel during soreness (muscular damage) is merely one factor among many. \n It is true: One of the mechanisms which is part of the hypertrophy stimulus seems to be damage to your muscles. It would be logical to assume that soreness, which comes from musle damage, is an indicator that hypertrophy is (or will be) happening. Even though the reasoning is logical, even that doesn't seem to be true in this simple form. \n For example you can do low intensity high rep endurance training. When you are not used to it, you will be sore. Very. On the other hand endurance training is not that great for hypertrophy. My current favorite explanation is that the kind of muscle damage which causes soreness and the type of damage which promotes hypertrophy are in some way different. \n Away from theory, to a", "Okay, so aesthetics it is. That makes things easier and a bit more complicated. \n It gets easy as far as training is concerned: What you need is pretty much a strength training routine. And since you are at bodyweightfitness I assume you would like one without weights. Thanks to our mods and other knowledgeable people there are routines here in the FAQ, and also at fitloop, which fit your needs very well and are also pretty well explained. You can just pick one and start. \n Tracking your progress is also easy: write down which exercise you are doing, how many reps you are doing, and have a look at how you progress, and advance through the progressions toward more difficult but cooler stuff. If you don't progress for several weeks, something is going wrong and it's time to start troubleshooting. All easy so far. \n Things get a bit more difficult with aesthetic goals, because of diet. There are sections on that in the /r/fitness FAQ and I think also around here. It's such a complicated topic, and there are so many approaches, one can easily feel overwhelmed. If you would like to have an easy first step into diet management, you can at first start a food diary for maybe a week or so: Just find a place where you jot down everything you eat. It will make you more conscious of what you are eating and, if you want to change your diet toward the healthy side, it will make that easier as well. \n That being said, you might just take a before and after pic in order to track your progress. Just one picture now, and one picture after... Let's say three months of strength training. The difference should be quite noticeable. \n > I would need to diet down to 12 % bodyfat? \n 12% is the point when when people really go: Yes, those are abs. That would be a reasonable long term goal for aesthetics. How long term depends on your physique, obviously. There are many people who naturally are that lean. And there are many for whom it requires years of effort in diet, calorie counting, and exercise to get there (short reminder: fitness is hard).

Let's say we've answered that annoying question of determining how complicated a system is: We calculated that this particular fridge is as complicated as my brain. \n The death of this argument lies in this question: Does \"understanding the fridge\" equal \"using every neuron of my brain to model every detail of the fridge\"? \n If you answer no, the argument falls apart. It would mean that I can understand the hellishly complicated fridge without using all of my brain to build a complete model. \n But if this equation: \"understanding = modelling\", holds true, something much more terrible happens to the argument. One can see it here: \n >Thus is holds with a more complicated system because the system would not be able to model the new system because it lacked the need complexity. \n To make it more apparent: No system can understand a system more complicated than itself, because the system would not be able to model the new system, because it lacked the needed complexity. \n As we have determined before, understanding = modelling. \n No system can model a system more complicated than itself, because the system would not be able to model the new system, because it lacked the needed complexity. \n And this is what we call a circular argument.

There are the redpillers which fit your description. And there are a lot of people who will disagree with much of what comes up in feminist discussion for entirely different reasons. \n I see it largely as a clash of cultures. As someone who has grown up in a STEM dominated environment, I have serious problems with the total lack of differentiation between fact of opinion in your comment. And that's not only your comment, it is what puts me off in most feminism centered discussions I encounter. \n If it is a fact, it needs a source. Scientific discussions tend to be full of links to at least wikipedia for references, and much of the surrounding discussion is focused on the evaluation of this or that study. \n It's different with feminism. I hardly ever seem to encounter sources, or discussions about them. It's the same with your piece here: There are many tall claims hidden in here, that seem to be naked opinion without a source. Are they just your opinion, or are they facts? I have no idea! You present everything you say as factual, and I have serious doubts about that. \n >Because we're raised in a society that teaches you that it is gentlemanly or chivalrous or honorable to make the women you care about happy and safe. \n Are we really? All of us? Which society? Anglo American? Continental European? Source? It seems like you are expressing your opinion here, but you could also express something that is a fact and supported by lots of hard data. Or it could be supported by little bad data. I can't tell what it is. I don't know what supports it. And that is a problem. \n >We are also raised to believe that (white) men can have whatever they want as long as they try hard enough. \"Work ethic\" they call it. \n Are we? Who exactly? Only white men? Source? Opinion? Fact? You don't tell me, and that leaves you in the grey area of people who seem to be trying to sell me opinion as fact. \n > I included white in parenthesis because people ask why black males in particular are \"so lazy,\" it's because our socioeconomic structure has taught them, their parents, and their friends through experience that hard work does not pay off, but that's an entirely different discussion. \n Opinion? Fact? It is stated as if it were true, but is there data to objectively prove that black people are \"lazy\" (first thing to prove) because they \"learned it through experience\" (claiming a causal link, second claim to prove)? If that doesn't exist, that again is only opinion, which you sell as factual. \n >However, combine that with constant bombardment by images that trivialize women's higher thinking abilities, their intellect, self-reliance, wage war on their self-image, and objectify the hell out of them, \n Does that happen?

And it is such a big claim, that I would be really interested in the proof behind it. \n >and we are teaching both women and men that women are objects whose worth is inherently less than that of men. \n Really? People do learn that? Needs proof. People learn that through media exposure (again, claiming a causal link)? That claim needs proof.

It people don't learn violence from them, even though it would seem reasonable that they should. \n >Think about it really hard, you probably discriminate without even noticing. Just think about how seriously you take your male friends' opinions and your female friends' opinions. You'll probably notice a slight discrepancy with no explanation behind it. That is the sexism that our culture instills in you from childhood. \n Now this is something else. This time you are not showing cultural bias, but you are showing the power of suggestion in leading questions. When you suggest that people will find a slight positive bias toward male opinion, people will tend to find what you suggest, not because it exists, but because you suggested its existence. \n If you want to prove this bias, that would need a solid study, which might well exist. The self experiment you suggest is by its nature misleading and will inevitably lead to a skewed result which, unsurprisingly, will support the point you want to make. \n If someone tries to do that kind of argumentative bullshit, and I catch him, that is a problem. How can I trust anything you say, if it seems like you want to trick me into agreement by using bullshit? \n >Here is a study done at Yale about women in the workplace. \n This is my favorite piece here. Because this is lacking in the most obvious thing I can think about when I think about gender differences: Children. \n You are comparing two equally qualified people. And when hiring one of them, you as an employer take the risk that this person will suddenly leave her job because of pregnancy and motherhood. Sometimes permanently. I think mothers giving up their jobs in order to raise a family is still a pretty common practice in our culture. \n Why the heck is this obvious, central, important factor not mentioned in the article? How should I trust any publication which doesn't mention the most central argument for differences in hiring and payment? I clearly shouldn't. \n > You are raised to believe women do not deserve to be rewarded for their hard work unless it's reward for pleasing a man. \n Fact or opinion?

I can't tell. It sounds like an impassioned speech, but never is there an indication that this merely is what you think or believe, or if it is supported by well researched facts... Source? \n And that ends this lengthy piece. \n So you are right. Redpillers are a fact of life, and probably some of the most stupid lifeforms on the planet. On the other hand, many people who disagree with feminist argument, are not redpillers. \n I disagree, because the arguments you bring seem to float in a strange world where facts and opinions seem to be treated equally. I can't tell where facts end and where your opinion starts. In most pro feminist articles and comments I can't tell. And for me, that is the moment when my bullshit detector starts beeping.

{"user_id": "Wollff", "subreddit": "Meditation", "posts": ["I think it is good to explain it with examples. \n Procrastination (or any other kind of behavior that is seen as neurotic) can be a good example: Someone sits around, knowing that they should really do something. But they are afraid to start, because in their minds this task is going to be really uncomfortable. It's going to be terrible torture! \n So they do something else instead, and try to think about something else. Which increases the fear of having to do the thing they don't want to do, and limits the time to do it even further. So they continue doing something else, while in the back of their minds the clock is ticking, and they start to feel like a pressure cooker... \n In the end this is a loop of thoughts and emotions that has an uncomfortable and harmful outcome. Loops like that are very common, and hardly ever are they so clear, so noticeable, and so clearly stupid, as in case of procrastination. \n Meditation is training yourself to recognize when you are doing things like that. It's training which enables you to recognize when you are doing something that is, upon close observation, obviously stupid. \n When you are really good at meditation you recognize that you should do something, and just do it. It's about not making unnecessary fuzz about things which are very easy if only one stops throwing internal tantrums. \n >she says this is just part of being human and what I aspire to is the same as being a robot. \n I think that is the unfortunate side effect of trying to explain meditation as \"not getting caught up in emotions and thoughts\". That really sounds like someone who is unhappy with the fact that there are emotions and thoughts, and who wants as little to do with those critters as possible. Keep them away from me, they are slimy and disgusting! \n In a way it is a bad explanation. Self torture on the other hand is very useful here. (aiming at /r/nocontext) Some people have a problem with cutting themselves. Even if those people see it as a way of self expression, and don't recognize it as a problem, from the outside it's pretty obvious that something seems to be going wrong. \n We are often doing things like that to ourselves, just internally. Meditation teaches us not only to recognize when we are doing that, but with sufficient practice we learn how we are doing that. We learn about the common pattern that lies within all unnecessary pain we inflict upon ourselves. \n I think that is a beautiful sentence. Since it took a wall of text to get there I will repeat it:", "As humans we're wired to experience negative emotions \n Wrong! Or at least not completely true. \n As humans we tend to put things into categories in order to make sense of the world: Some emotions make us feel good. We put those into a drawer labelled \"positive emotions\". Some emotions make us feel bad. Those we put into the stinky sock drawer labeled \"negative emotions\". \n I think the first question you need to clear up is: Are there negative emotions? \n I don't think so. What happens is that an emotion comes up, and then we put a label on it (makes me do the clenched teeth and frowny face thing... must be \"anger\"!), then we search our categorization sock drawers (Where does anger belong? That's easy! It's in the \"negative emotion\" drawer), and based on those decisions we decide on our reactions (when \"anger\" comes up that means you need to shout and punch, but since we are civilized people we rather take the general \"negative emotion\" reactions our parents taught us: avoidance and rationalization).", "That depends. On the one hand there is happiness the mood and the feeling. In regard to meditation you get that in concentration meditation in the first Jhana. It's something along the lines of \"happiest moment of my life\"-stuff, overwhelming bliss which gives rise to overwhelming happiness. \n So, that's happiness, the feeling and the mood. And then there is happiness \"from perspective\". \n >But I thought about this and asked \"what if you removed the perspective or point of view?\" then there's no one to suffer. \n Which is basically that. The intuitive understanding that it always is so, is what a few traditions refer to as enlightenment. \n >You just feel and that's it, no thinking about how bad this or that is or was. \n Aaand this already goes too far: There may be thinking about how bad this or that is. But those are just thoughts. They are essentially just like the \"this or that\" they are about. Even thoughts are not as fundamentally bad as they sometimes might seem. \n > How can anyone feel happy and still feel chemically unbalanced? \n Well, that is a strange way to put it. I don't think you  feel  chemically unbalanced. I think those two things are identical: Feeling consistently unhappy is equal to being chemically unbalanced in a certain way. Those are the same thing. \n When you are happy, that  is  a brain doing certain stuff. When one is unhappy, that  is  a brain doing certain other stuff. One is the subjective perspective from the inside, the other is the objective perspective from the outside. That's the only difference. \n > If you lack serotonin, then you are not happy, according to neuroscience. Is this a conclusion or there's more that's not being said or just not understood enough? \n It has been some time since I encountered the neuroscience of depression the last time. What one needs to understand is that neurotransmitters are not a fixed resource. They are produced internally, and their production is regulated by internal and external mechanisms. \n Eating ice cream, for example, makes us happy. That's because eating sugary stuff leads to complex things happening in the brain and our hormone systems. You will suddenly have more dopamine secretion in certain areas of your brain (rewards and learning are the keywords here), because you eat sugary ice cream. Even eating ice cream changes your brain chemistry! \n And so does everything you do. \n In many cases an \"imbalance in brain chemistry\" can be the result of years of behavior and learning that lead to such an imbalance. Sometimes an \"imbalance in brain chemistry\" is closely related to an \"imbalance in thinking and behavior\". Correct thinking and behavior, and the imbalance in brain chemistry also vanishes. That's why psychotherapy can work. \n On the other hand there are also genetic factors which can at least heavily predispose some people to depressive disorders. When there is such an \"organic component\" to depression, medication may always be necessary to address an imbalance that can otherwise not be fixed because the body is simply unable to (disclaimer: in other cases medication is helpful and necessary too). \n What I want to point out: Brain chemistry is a two way street. It can be affected from the inside, by regulating our thinking and behavior in certain ways. By learning we can rebuild our brains and change our brain chemistry to a certain extent. \n And brain chemistry can be changed from the outside by medication. \n When one thinks that our thinking and feeling is in some way beyond our access form the inside, just because they literally are chemical reactions, that is a misunderstanding. The thing to take away from this?", "Well, no. This hardly ever happens around here (/r/Zen is another matter). At least that's my impression. \n Unless a certain fool called aAtaDota gets funny ideas again. But that's a matter for the mods to decide (I tell you, ban him when he does it again! It's a matter of law and order!). \n But seriously: I think macjoven hits the nail on the head by calling it a rhetorical maneuver. It doesn't solve any problems, it doesn't answer any questions, it just leads the discussion in a different direction which in many cases has nothing to do with the topic at hand. It's the ultimate red herring of meditation. \n In many cases it's a mistake to respond to it (unless one is interested in starting a zen circlejerk, but there are other subs for that).", "Put another way, while meditation can benefit an individual greatly, is it always a net gain on a societal level? \n What lies in this question is certainty about progress. Progress is good. We gain something when we progress! \n This is an unjustified certainty. Progress is not good. It is not necessarily bad either. But whether how society changes with it, is best described as a \"gain\", is a more difficult question than most people think. \n I will not even start with humans. Look at wild animals in their natural habitat. Are they unhappy? \n Do you think their state of being is utterly miserable, without  any  of the societal and technological achievements we humans have? I think the answer from most people nowadays will be a clear no. \n What we can draw from that is the conclusion that we, if we had decided to continue living in animal simplicity, would not necessarily live in unhappy misery. If you look at simple lifestyles of hunter gatherer tribes, that seems to hold true: Not much progress, but certainly not miserable. \n So what exactly is the \"gain\" on the societal level we have \"gained\" with progress? Probably not happiness. \n What we certainly have gained is the ability to do  stuff . But is that important? I can now fly around the world in maybe two days or so, while Jules Verne was still impressed with 80 days! \n Well,  great , the cynic in me mumbles. Absolutely useless.

Oh, and you have to smile when you go to sleep. \n If that's all you are aiming for, you don't need  any  theory: Everyone but PUAs does social interaction in that naked, awkward, hilarious and clumsy way. \n You only need theory if your social interactions are not the spectacular fireworks you would like them to be.

You define it in a nihilisitc manner: Outcome independence means that one isn't allowed to care about outcomes. That is not a very good definition for the reasons you outline. \n A better definition: Outcome independence means that your happiness is independent from the outcome of a certain action. \n >If you reduce your emotional investment in a particular outcome, doesn't that by its very nature reduce the satisfaction of a successful close? \n Your premise is flawed. Let's test it with a simple example: I buy a lottery ticket. \n You are claiming that I can only be happy about the million dollars I win if I am emotionally invested in the outcome: I can only be happy about winning, if I am ready to be equally unhappy about losing. \n I don't think that's true. When I buy a lottery ticket knowing that I will still be perfectly content with my life, even if I don't win the grand prize, I can still be insanely happy about winning. And if I lose, it's no big deal. \n I don't  need  the million dollar prize to be happy. But I  can  still be as insanely happy about is as anybody else. That's outcome independence. \n >If I actually don't care what this girl thinks of me, then why should it feel good when she digs me? \n Who says that you may not care about what a girl thinks of you? Outcome independence only means that your happiness is independent from the outcome. \n If you don't get the girl to like you, you can still mope about not getting something you really  wanted , if you like. But you don't need to despair about not getting something you  needed  for your happiness. \n The term \"needy\" sounds the way it does for a reason.", "isn't it necessarily putting a ceiling on how much you care about a particular girl's opinion of you? \n Putting in a ceiling on how much you care about other people's opinions is a healthy thing to do. You can't control what others think. That's their decision. If you let others decide how you feel, depending on their current approval rating of you, you are walking a thorny path. \n >The bottom line is that even if you're \"outcome independent\" you're still LESS happy at the end of the night if you don't close the girl than if you did. \n Yes, that's what the lottery ticket analogy boils down to: If you don't win the jackpot, you will probably not experience the manic joy that comes with winning millions of dollars. \n But even if you don't win, don't close, or crash and burn in hilarious glory, if you are outcome independent you never wager your happiness. I was a little sloppy in my previous post. I sometimes used happiness, where joy would have been a more appropriate word. In my defense: Those two are easy to confuse. And that confusion often leads to problems. \n When you win in the lottery, you might believe that money will bring you happiness. When you start to improve your game, you might believe the women and the lifestyle will make you genuinely happy. Many a millionaire and PUA can attest: This isn't so. At least in the long term many become frustrated: \"I have all I wished for, so why am I still not happy?\" \n The other side of the coin are the people who desire something oh so strongly: \"I can never be truly happy unless I drive a 300HP car\", or: \"I will forever be a miserable sob, unless I finally get more experience with women\", are a few of the usual statements. \n Money, women, cars: Those external things can bring you joy. But happiness, that's something you have to get from within yourself. \n And thus, finally, we come full circle: \n Outcome dependent people mistake joy for happiness. Thus they mistake things they want for things they need. \n Outcome independent people realize that external things can bring them joy, but that happiness is firmly rooted in the realm of inner game.

This term \"loser\" seems damn hard to pin down, doesn't it? \n That's because \"loser\" is an arbitrary label with varying definitions. \n Only because Billy from class 3 defines you as a loser, doesn't make you one. Same thing for society. Same thing for yourself: Even if you think you are a loser, that doesn't make you one. You are probably just being illogical, because at the end of the day \"loser\" is just a label we slap on people we want to hurt. \n Whether that's a smart thing to do is something you decide. \n There are quite a few other things that are ever so slightly illogical in there, above all this: \n >If I spend another year just sitting around watching as my youth slips away I'll blow my brains out. \n So you are going to kill yourself if you don't manage to go out more often next year?

To me that sounds slightly illogical. Why? Well, try to find reasons yourself (false dichotomy etc). Yes, talking to yourself can sometimes be a really healthy game to play. \n That is a little part of the mental judo that makes up so much of inner game.

But was it knowledge at one point? \n If you had asked someone around the beginning of the 18th century if he considered that knowledge, they would have answered with a yes. If you had asked someone at the end of that century, they would have answered with a no. \n And if you ask an analytic philosopher, he will probably answer: \"Some  believed that to be knowledge at one point. It has never really been knowledge, because this sentence obviously isn't true\" \n Which places us in a precarious and, in my opinion, rather idiotic position: Some of the things we call knowledge, are not really knowledge, because they are not true. Other things we call knowledge really are knowledge. And we can never clearly distinguish between the real knowledge and the believed knowledge: In the light of new evidence everything we call knowledge can in principle be falsified and proven not to be knowledge. \n How dumb is that position? Very dumb. Let me illustrate: \n \"Speciation happens by evolution\" \n Is that knowledge? Maybe. Because we can't be 100% sure that it's true. We could find contrary evidence at any time. So we can't call this knowledge. As a matter of fact we can't call anything knowledge (even though we do it all the time). \n The only thing we can say is that we believe something to be knowledge. \n According to the definition the best you can say is: \"I believe that speciation by evolution constitutes knowledge\". Cringing already? Me too. \n You avoid that if you define knowledge as merely justified belief. Which also avoids the whole Gettier problem and places knowledge and belief in the gradual relationship they have in reality. \n Once a belief becomes very well justified, it becomes knowledge. Its truth has nothing to do with that.", "In this way, we really haven't changed anything: implicit truth is truth just the same. \n Not quite. With the JTB definition knowledge is something absolute. The Phlogiston theory was never knowledge and never will be, because it isn't true. \n With the JB definition at one point it was knowledge, until it wasn't justified anymore. Then it stopped being knowledge. \n It's a pretty radical change, actually. What constitutes knowledge becomes much more context dependent and much more flexible. \n >Well, except that we still have the Gettier problem. It hasn't went away. There are still JBs (or JTBs...whatever) hanging around that aren't regarded as knowledge. \n Let's take the classical [case I]( from the page you linked. \n With the JB definition it looks as follows: Does Smith know that Jones will get the job? Yes, even though that's not true, it's a justified belief. Does Smith know that the guy who will get the job has 10 coins in his pocket? Yes, because it's a justified belief. And it's totally irrelevant if anyone else has got coins hidden somewhere, or not. \n Or even more extreme in the case with the dog in sheep's clothing: A guy drives by a farm and sees a sheep. Does he know there was a sheep on the farm? Yes. What if in reality it was a dog in sheep's clothing? He still knows that there's a sheep on the farm (even though he's wrong). What if there was a sheep hidden behind the hill? Still yes, but there's no harm in being accidentally right when it doesn't change anything. \n The main counter to that line of reasoning would be that this doesn't solve the Gettier problem at all since we still don't call all those justified true things knowledge. \n To which I would reply: Don't we? People who know about JTB and have been working with that definition for a long time don't call those things knowledge, precisely because they go by that definition. If you do that and hit a Gettier problem, the distinction of whether something is knowledge or not suddenly starts to depend on on hidden sheep you don't know about. No wonder one wouldn't want to call that stuff knowledge! \n That doesn't happen with the JB definition: Depending on whether you see something as a qualified belief, or not, it remains knowledge, or loses that status. And it doesn't matter if someone has hidden coins in your pants. \n The second big criticism would be the loss of the distinction between \"know\" and \"think to know\". But ever since you assured me that \n > no one has a crystal ball regarding a posteriori knowledge \n that distinction seems to be meaningless anyway: The best thing we can have is a \"think to know\", so we don't need that distinction.", "But no one considers any of the Gettier cases to illustrate instances of knowledge \n Let's test the instances our with our \"notion\" then: Someone drives by a pasture and sees a sheep standing there. Does that person know that there is a sheep? My notion says: Yes (JTB says: No, he merely thinks he knows that, just like everything else. Doesn't matter what he has to say about that!). Does the person know that there's a sheep on that pasture? Yes, because he saw that sheep (JTB says: Yes, but only if there's a platonic sheep, which is guaranteed to be a sheep. But that even works if it's hidden from sight behind that hill). \n The only point where my notion gets confused: The sheep actually is a dog. Does the man still know he saw a sheep? Here it depends on the perspective I take. From an outside observer's view I'd say that he indeed only thinks he knows. From the man's perspective though... Nothing has changed for him. He still knows in the the same way I knew that Santa exists when I was 4. Or that I know now that evolution is true. \n >All of them violate the \"notion\" of knowledge that epistemoligists are trying to figure out how to properly define. \n JTB pretty obviously isn't a way to do that, because every time someone says: \"I know x\", he doesn't fulfill the necessary requirements for knowledge: Truth is a necessary requirement for knowledge. You merely assume the truth of x.  Thus you don't know x. I don't see any wiggle room here. Even if we can assume the truth for practical purposes most of the time (which means: use the JB definition), it doesn't change the fact that the JTB definition doesn't reflect our use of the term at all. \n >Damn straight it's knowledge! Look at all this research! ... \n You just wrote the frustrated answer of a biologist to someone who experienced a miracle. God reached into the head of some poor soul and revealed the absolute truth to the believer and now that person argues: \"All your justifications for evolution don't matter, because the theory isn't true! I just know that! That's why I can discard your justifications without even looking at them!\" \n When you have a JB it doesn't just turn out to be false by magic. Something turns out to be false because of results which undermine your justification(s) and bring the whole tower down though internal inconsistencies or inconsistencies with observation. \n >One can justify the shit out of something and still come out on the wrong side of truth. \n Yes. I can justify the shit out of: \"The Earth orbits the sun\", and might still be wrong. \n >I can have a JB that's false. \n Okay, so you take: \"The sun orbits the Earth\" \n >We can sword fight all day long. \n Let's not. It might be more productive if we compared our predictions and tested our competing knowledge for consistency with observations: We collect evidence and put it on a pile. My pile will end up higher, with all the things your theory explains and some things your theory couldn't explain at all. Any maybe there will even be some predictions in your pile that didn't work at all. \n If my theory explains more things and explains them better while making fewer mistakes, can you still claim the belief in your theory is justified? I don't think so. \n If you say yes now: I don't see how truth would help us out. \n >Justification to what end? \n Consistency. \n >I can now use \"feelings\" as my justification for knowledge if I wish. \n You sure can try. If you can produce results which are consistent with observation, free from internal contradictions, and allow reliable predictions, that would be perfectly fine.

And your abuse of this word makes me feel a little queasy. \n The word naturalist already exists and has a meaning.

If I say that I am a naturalist, I could still believe anything about gods, and will probably be mistaken for a person who likes to run around naked. Great choice. \n >Those of us who are actually atheist get to reclaim the word \"atheist\" \n Reclaim?! You are confusing words again.

He knows, no matter what, that if I'm telling him to make it rain on a rooftop because there's a sniper up there, there's a sniper up there that needs to be dead to keep the rest of us alive, and he knows that I won't ask him to shoot if I wouldn't take the shot myself.

Still, you phrased it like it would be difficult to make them go do it. It's not. \n > AP rounds for pistols have been around a long time (think before you were born). You just have no experience with them. The APLP is just the latest twist on pistol AP rounds. Before them it was tungsten carbide chisel tips with polymer coating and +P pressures (FFS they even used them in hollywood movies in the 90s). Before that it was needle point brass rounds. \n And? Still no source for performance. At all. \n > As for your pdw argument...you now want to replace a lightweight sidearm with basically a carbine....and consider that to be good thing. Heres a tip. The M9 and ammo weighs well under 5 lbs and fits on your hip/shoulder/mole rig/etc. P90 and MK18 do not. Your entire idea is stupid and unworkable. You seriously want soliders carrying to main weapons platforms and ammo for both? Christ that is asinine. \n Well, Marines already carry two weapon platforms, as I mentioned before. Staff and O draw M9s and M4s and without fail an M240 or SMAW gunner ends up with an M16, because he still needs to be armed when he's away from his crew-served. Feel free to pose this question over in r/USMC. I'm not a fan of anecdotes, so I urge you to seek out majority opinions from other vets who beenderedonedat and bitched about it in the smokepit. Pretty sure there's a Terminal Lance rant about it. \n Anyway, fopr the frontline folks, the PDW they carry is smaller and lighter than an M16. M240 gunners will still rely on the guy behind them if they get jumped, because they're still not getting issued M9s, and generally not carrying the M16s or M4s on patrol in addition to their guns. They may not carry the PDWs either. We can also free up M4s by giving Staff and O PDWs instead of issuing them two weapons. Their job isn't to fight, it's to lead and control their units. Or run logistics like a badass. Oorah Gunny. \n For the rest of them, you'd be eliminating their M4 or M16 and M9 (which they rarely get issued) with a PDW. Again, these are not front-line dudes, they're tankers, AAV crew, Arty, Motor T or CAAT drivers, etc. \n > Good luck grabbing the carbine slung across your back when SHTF and you are in truly close quarter combat....you know the time and place that a pistol will most likely probably be used. \n If it was issued, which it's not. Also the guys carrying sidearms are normally carrying a crew-served and would be basically fucked in that scneario. That's what the guy behind you is for. You fight hand-to-hand while your buddy comes and puts a boot in Makmud's jaw. Anyway, they don't issue sidearms for that reason, or at least not in any TO I've seen. \n > Since no one in basic told you, the whole point of a pistol is as a backup weapon so you can fight your way to a working rifle. Its a weapon of last resort. Thus lightweight is paramount. Easy to use in tight quarters is paramount. \n Again, not in any TO for pistols I've seen. It's for people for whom a rifle is too large and cumbersome. Nobody outside SF and some special duty (I.E. STA bubba carryign the M40, corpsman, MP) is getting issued a rifle and a pistol. SF do it, but they actually get serious trigger-time on pistols, and further, don't use standard-issue gear, so whatever the bulk order is won't effect them much, now will it? \n CivDiv is different. Purpose of a handgun is entirely different, and out of the scope of this discussion. \n > The army looked into PDWs, tested them extensively (its why there was suddenly so many available...they all wanted the contract) and it was found that the increased logistic headaches, increase training requirement, and their tendency to jam, made them less than optimal for all but VERY niche needs. Yes they look all cool and shit and the leet operators use them. BUT for most scenarios, the cons outweighed the limited benefits. \n PDWs have a tendency to jam? Logistics isn't an issue if you're replacing the sidearm anyway. Increased training? [SAUCE] on all this. \n > Yes they can be workable IF you put in the shitton of training, but thats not workable for most of the people who would 'need' them. \n [citation needed] on extensive training. \n > Of course you would know all this if you actually had a clue about what you were talking about...or hell even talked to anyone with experience with the PDWs. \n I'm of the opinion you're talking out of your ass.

My SO and I have both received ours already. \n I'm a big proponent of flu shots. I didn't bother getting them growing up, but once I became an adult, I started getting one every year. Now, I hate needles. I remember getting my HPV vaccine and faining in the lobby after receiving the third shot. But after having my son and getting that epidural, shots have become one of those things that, while I might not  enjoy  doing it, it \"might as well happen.\" \n Last year was the kicker that really got me believing in them. I was big and pregnant right as flu season was in full swing. I was probably five months when the nurse offered me a flu shot at my doctor's appointment. She gave me a pamphlet to read, and told me she'd be back in ten minutes to chat. It laid out some really important information that I have since reinforced from my job and own research: \n \n The flu shot is most important for the elderly, those who are already sick, pregnant women, and the very young.  Why? Well, the truth is that the flu on its own doesn't usually kill people. It  can , but most of the time, you get sick, your body fights it off, and you move on with your life. But for those groups of people, it's not that simple. These people have weakened or compromised immune systems. A simple flu can lay siege to an already weak body, and the chance of complications is exponentially higher. Think dehydration via diarrhea (big killer, actually!), pneumonia, and other nasty infections. It's like Pertussis: in an adult, it sucks, but in a baby, the risks are extremely high. They don't have the immune system to fight it off that well. This is also why most medical professionals are required to get one; if you're frequently around people who are vulnerable, you could pass it onto them. Even if getting the flu might not be a big deal for you, it could be for them. That's why my employer gives us our shots for free and actually tracks which employees get them: I come into contact with sick people every day. It helps protect them more than it probably protects me. Not everyone has to get the shot, but the more people that get it, the better protected weaker people are. \n \n GETTING THE FLU SHOT WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE FLU.  What's that? \"Every time\" you get the flu shot you get the flu? If I had a nickel for every time someone spits this anecdote at me, I would probably own a house. No joke. And as nice and convenient as it is, unfortunately, that's not how it works. There is no live virus in a flu shot. There are cells, sure, but they're dead; that's how the shot works. It injects the dead cells for your body to fight so that it produces antibodies. That way, if your body does come into contact with that particular strain of the flu later on, it already has the defense measures in place to stop it before it becomes a big deal. But there is no way the flu shot can give you the flu, from a scientific standpoint. It's like the autism debate: coincidence =/= evidence. So, why  would  you still get sick?... \n \n Getting a flu shot will not guarantee you don't get sick.  The flu shot only protects against 3  strains of the flu. This year they're actually rolling out a shot that protects against 4 (2 group A, 2 group B), but availability on that depends on location. Every year, medical professionals (see:  much more educated on this than we are*) predict which strains are likely to be active in the coming flu season. Those are the strains that make it into the shot. No, I don't know precisely how they predict it. The thing is, there are dozens upon dozens of strains of the flu: it mutates just like most other bugs do. That's why they put three strains in one shot. So even if you get a shot, it's not a guarantee that you might not come down with another strain that's floating around. That's why a lot of people still get sick: they either wait too long to get their shot (thus contracting the virus before antibodies have been sufficiently produced), or they simply come down with a strain that wasn't in the shot. It happens. Doesn't mean the shot gave you the virus. \n \n The best time to get a flu shot is before people start getting sick.  In a pharmacy environment, as soon as those signs go up, go get one. Or you can call your doctor and ask when it's coming in. If you wait too long, again, it might be too late. Most viruses have incubation periods where you carry it around before showing symptoms; if you get a shot while the season is in full swing, chances are you've already been exposed. Right now, we're recommending people get it by Thanksgiving. You can get it later on, but the best time to get it is, again, sooner rather than later. That gives you a couple months to go get one, and more and more pharmacies and clinics are offering walk-in shots. Hell, I've seen nurses giving them at Walmart. It really doesn't take that long. Most insurance companies these days will cover it as preventive healthcare, and if they don't (rare), it's usually in the range of $20~35 without any insurance at all. I've been told anecdotally by patients that some clinics will do them for free if you're low-income, but I have to write that off as an incidental/location based thing. I know there's a clinic in my area that gives them out for free to people in at-risk categories. \n \n \n Case in point: last year's flu. I wasn't working at a pharmacy last year, but my SO was. Last year, a lot of people said \"thanks, but no thanks\" to the flu shot. We live in one of those states that had extremely high flu activity. I got a shot, he got a shot, and we went on our way. I'm not sure how many people remember this, but last year's flu was pretty freaking nasty. Within the course of a few days, the flu exploded over the media because people were getting really sick, and the death count was getting bad. People panicked and started flooding offices and pharmacies for shots. Down here, it got so bad that our employer actually had to start rationing the shots. We couldn't keep up with demand. Nobody wanted it early on, so we didn't have a gigantic inventory on hand to meet the frenzied panic of people who turned on the TV and read LETHAL FLU KILLS 7. We had pregnant women, kids, and seniors, whom we had to start turning away because we were running out of shots. It was all-on hysteria down here, and it was thanks to people who waited until flu season was in full, axe-wielding swing. I caught the nasty strain of the flu right before I delivered, and my son was born with me breathing in an oxygen mask coughing up phlegm with a fever over 102. I can vouch that I caught it from \"I don't believe in vaccines\" coworkers who came into work sick. My MIL was doing chemo and wound up in the hospital with a massive intestinal infection that would have killed her had we not brought her in when we did. Why? Because she had no immune system, and even the smallest bug could cascade into a lethal infection. Very scary stuff.", "So our little dude was starting to sleep well. Three 1~2 hour naps a day, then a 5~6 hour long stretch at night, followed by a 3 hour stretch, then a 2 hour stretch. Not perfect, but not bad. But then, around three weeks ago, he completely regressed, and hasn't gone back since. Most nights we're lucky to get 4 hours in his first stretch, and then anywhere arbitrarily from 1~2.5 hours, shortening the closer to dawn we get. He hasn't slept in past 5:30 this entire time, no matter what time we put him to bed. I try to put him down around 6 or 6:30, but some nights he passes out at 5, some nights he's wide awake until 7. Efforts to put him on a schedule are pretty futile. His naps wind up being around the same-ish time each day (usually at around 7:30, 11, and 2: sometimes he sneaks in a fourth at 4), but only one,  sometimes  two are more than 20 minutes long. We've tried various bedtime routines and schedules, but it doesn't seem to make a scrap of difference. I'm exhausted. I'm putting in my two weeks today, actually, because the schedule they try to put me on (see: staying to close, which tonight is going to be 11:15) doesn't mesh with an early-riser and an overwhelming amount of housework. I'd rather go back to school anyways. \n We went to the pediatrician a couple weeks ago for shots and a checkup (torticollis and a flat head, but that's a separate discussion.) She asked us how he was sleeping. I told her, and she immediately said, \"no no no, he shouldn't be doing that.\" She told us -- and gave us a handout -- that explicity laid out to do CIO. And yes, it said \"2 months\" at the top. As she instructed, \"change him, feed him, get him calm; then put him down, close the door, and walk out. He's going to cry: let him.\" I tried explaining that, ok, but what about when he wakes up four times in the middle of the night for feeding? ((He usually takes a solid 10~12 ounces during the night.)) \"Leave him,\" she said. \"He's big enough that he shouldn't have to eat at night. He  wants  to, because that's what he's used to, but he doesn't  have  to. It's about comfort more than hunger.\" He's 14 pounds. \n Now, the initial CIO (when it's bed time, he's tired, but doesn't want to sleep) I'm not that against. Some nights he really does just need to fuss it out. He gets worked up and overtired, and then fights sleep. We've witnessed him sitting in the swing crying for a minute before passing right out enough times to know this. But my SO and I are in opposition as to how long to let him go for, and what to do for the rest of the night. \n My opinion is that he can't go a full 8~10 hours without eating at night. The longest he's ever gone is 7 hours (once), and as soon as he woke up, he downed 6 ounces in one sitting. Most intervals between feeds are 3, 4 hours max. A full night is ridiculous. He's three months old. I've got nothing against letting him fuss for a few minutes, trying to give him the pacifier: sometimes, that's really all he needs. But putting him in the other room and letting him scream for an hour when he's (imo) probably hungry? Come on. \n His opinion is that the pediatrician is a doctor, and we are not. He thinks that we need to stop giving him the bottle when he wakes up crying, and that sleep training him now is what we need to do. Currently, the baby sleeps in our room (1br apartment.) He wants to put the baby to bed out in his pack n play in the living room, or outright move the crib, and just leave him out there for the whole night. He thinks that we have to do this now because of how sleep-deprived I am at this point. \n So far, we've bounced back and forth. On nights that he's here, if the baby is being difficult going to bed, he will take the baby from me, put him in the bedroom, and let him cry, and tell me to stay out. I've only purposefully done it myself a couple times. The time it takes him to fall asleep  is  decreasing: the first couple times took 45 minutes of wailing, and now he's down within 20. But the baby has also developed some pretty nasty separation anxiety, especially with regards to me. He starts crying his sad cry the second I set him down on the crib because -- imo -- he  knows  what's coming. We only once attempted to leave him alone all night. He woke up, and my SO took him out to the living room and left him there. He cried for over an hour before I finally got up, told my SO that this was stupid, and retrieved him. Sure enough, he was starving. One bottle later, and he went to bed. But again, as my SO insists, the pediatrician said he  can  make it, he just doesn't want to. And I don't disagree that there's a separation anxiety/comfort issue going on. I also am desperate for real sleep. But I'm not sold on the not-actually-hungry thing. \n Any suggestions? Tiebreakers? Personal experiences? Everything I've read says no sleep training before 4 months, optimally 6. But we've also been told differently by the pediatrician."], "anchor_demographics": {"age": 30, "gender": "female", "occupation": "pharmacy employee", "location": "United States"}, "shift_vector": {"POWER": 0.05, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.1, "HEDONISM": 0.1, "STIMULATION": 0.15, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.55, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.6, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.9, "TRADITION": 0.2, "CONFORMITY": 0.7, "SECURITY": 0.85}, "target_vector": {"POWER": 0.05, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.1, "HEDONISM": 0.1, "STIMULATION": 0.15, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.55, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.6, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.9, "TRADITION": 0.2, "CONFORMITY": 0.7, "SECURITY": 0.85}}
{"user_id": "AnyelevNokova", "subreddit": "BabyBumps", "posts": ["All over the place. \n I started receiving secondhand stuff from a coworker probably around... 18, 19 weeks? I bought a few small things myself, as did my MIL and coworkers. But I waited until after Christmas to start  buying  things (so, 32, 33 weeks.) The vast majority of our stuff has been within the last month, including most of the big-ticket items: crib, mattress, car seat, stroller, linens, toiletries, etc. \n I've been super lucky in that I have several coworkers who have had boys within the last year and a half, and they've been more than willing to pawn off their secondhand stuff on me. I'll guiltily admit that probably half of what we have is secondhand (and thirdhand, fourthand, etc.) We've got more bottles and blankets than I know where to put, and grossly more 0-6 mos clothes than we're going to need. But I figure, if someone else at the store doesn't get pregnant soon, we can yard sale some of it and donate the rest.", "And then I figured I wouldn't need to spay her because she would always be inside. \n This is a similar reasoning my MIL used to not spay their female dog. Why spay her? It's expensive and \"invasive.\" So they didn't. Sure enough, she had a litter. Ok, fine. They gave away most of the litter and kept two. They got all the male dogs in the house fixed (again, instead of fixing the  one  female),  except  one of the dogs they kept from the litter. He was the runt, he's partially blind, and, put bluntly, retarded. \"He wouldn't know how to have sex, and it's his mom!\" \n Wrong. They walk outside one day while she's in heat, and mister runt is humping mother dearest. So she has  another  litter. An  inbred  litter. They kept one dog of that litter (bringing their total to six) and gave the rest away. The dog they kept from the second litter is even  worse  than his father. They frequently discuss giving him away, sending him to the pound, or even going out back and shooting him. He's  horrible . But they don't. \n To this day, their female dog still isn't fixed. If she ever got outside while in heat, I have no doubt she'd find a way to get pregnant  again . It baffles me why they don't just fix her.", "Backing this up. I've been getting it too for the past couple weeks. It comes and goes, but seems to be worse when I have a full bladder. It's never been period strength, but I've definitely had a few moments of strong discomfort. I just remind myself that, hey, there's a thing growing inside me that is literally stretching me out. If that doesn't make a lady cramp, I don't know what will. And I haven't had a single speck of bleeding.", "Avoid:  everyone and their mother will be buying these things \n \n Baby soap, shampoo, powder, etc. I got  over a dozen  bottles of these things at my shower. They're practical gifts, but a lot of parents (like me, and several coworkers) wind up with near-lifetime supplies from the shower alone. \n \n Newborn and 0-3mos onesies or outfits. They're cute, but chances are they're going to receive a lot of them, and most babies don't wear these sizes for very long. \n \n Bottles and bottle brushes. Unless you know explicitly that they're formula feeding and still need these things, skip these. I'm breastfeeding (and open about it) and I still received five bottle brushes and a couple dozen bottles. Yeah. \n \n Blankets and swaddling blankets. Similar vein as bottles: chances are they're going to receive too many. They're cute, but they pile up. \n \n Towels and washcloths. Again, unless you  explicitly  know that they need them en masse, assume they're going to receive at least a couple dozen from other people. \n \n \n Ask First:  great if they need it, pointless if they don't \n \n Crib sets. I'd avoid giving a  set  unless you know exactly what they want. But it's a wonderful gift if they do want one. \n \n Pacifiers. Definitely an item no one wants to be caught without, but they really fall down to the preference of the parents-to-be. Some people will take any pacificers, others are firmly loyal to one brand or style. If they have a registry, that's your ticket to this particular item. Otherwise, either ask first, or forget about it. \n \n Toys. You're probably ok buying a rattler, teether, or some other small, practical toy. But anything larger, such as blocks, play mats, whatever, should probably be skipped unless it's on the registry or explicitly asked for. The good news on these is that kids are fickle and, odds are, it'll be used eventually. But you don't know what they have, so follow the parents' lead on this. \n \n \n \n Larger clothing sizes (9mos+). Some parents will go buy the entire layette from 0-24mos as soon as they find out they're expecting. Others will receive hand-me-downs. But a lot of people tend to hit a gap in their layette right around 9~12 months (see: everyone buys small sizes for gifts.) If they need larger sizes, this is a great buy. But definitely check first. \n \n Larger-ticket items. We're talking pack and play, diaper genie, car seat, stroller, harness/wrap, [fancy swings]( or rockers, monitors, furniture: anything like that. If they still need it, anything big-ticket will be well-received. But you  need  to check with the parents: first to find out if they still need it, and then, if they do still need it, what, specifically, they would like. If you can't acquire this specific information, don't risk getting something big that they don't want or need. Registries help here, but I'd still inquire anyway. \n \n Feeding supplies (solids.) Bowls, spoons, food mashers and processors, high chairs, anything of that sort. They might receive a couple of these items, but not nearly as much as they're going to receive in other categories. Great gifts if they don't have them yet. \n \n \n Safe Bets:  no one else will buy it, and they need it \n \n Diapers. Sure, it's not cute and fuzzy. But babies need diapers, period. Sniff out what kind they're using (disposable or cloth: if cloth, what kind/brand), and purchase appropriately. If no one knows what kind of diapers they're using, newborn or size one diapers are almost always a good idea for those sleepless nights early on, for travel, or for visits to reluctant relatives' homes. \n \n Bedding. There's a distinction here between crib sets and bedding: I'm not talking bumpers and blankets. Sheets and (to a limit) mattress protectors are  always  good to have extra of. When in doubt, a couple white or cream-colored crib sheets will be a helpful gift. \n \n Swaddlers and sleep sacks/gowns! Distinction from swaddling blankets, these are two items that most of us would love to get and don't. [Swaddlers]( can be a lifesaver for new parents and are easier to work with than a swaddling blanket. Likewise, sleep sacks or gowns are helpful for diaper changes: no fussing with clothes, you just let them sleep like that. Some parents, of course, don't like these items. But most do, and again, they're probably not receiving these from anyone else. \n \n Postpartum supplies for mom. Yes, it can be embarrassing (that's why no one buys them), but she'll thank you later.  Do not buy these if you are not a woman. You will get stared at.  Check the registry to see if there's anything she's thrown on there in this category. If she's listed a breast pump on her registry, and you can afford it, that sucker will instantly win you Best Gift. Again: the registry is the key to this. If all else fails, a gift card to Walgreens/CVS will come in handy (see next bullet.) \n \n Gift cards. Yes, it's impersonal and not particularly flashy. But gift cards are lifesavers. You have three ways to go on this: general, baby-related, or service. In general, a gift card to the local pharmacy (Walgreens, CVS) or grocery store (Safeway, Walmart, Target) will help their suddenly-shrunken wallet. Always safe. A baby-related gift card (baby stores) will help them fill in the gaps. However, I'd give this only if you know they're going to run short: it's useless if they're pretty much done. A service card (maid service, diaper service, delivery food) can be extremely helpful, but don't get one unless you explicitly know they're going to use it from that particular service ((i.e. don't get a Domino's card when they're loyal to Pizza Hut.)) Safest bets are big-box stores, but if they'd like something/somewhere specific, that's even better. \n \n \n General Protips (all that", "My boyfriend said pretty much the same thing at first. \n \"This is going to ruin both of us.\" \"You're not thinking logically.\" \"We're never going to be able to do anything again.\" \n His mother (at first) and my parents (still) said the same things. \n Now, however, his mother is sympathetically supportive, and he's getting over it.

She was Hispanic with black hair and wanted to go blonde;  super  blonde. She wanted to know which hair dye would get her blonde without bleaching (\"because I ruined my hair bleaching it.\") I tried to tell her that it was pretty much impossible without bleach; black to blonde is as far across the spectrum as you can go. There's no gentle, easy, \"I'll just buy a box once\" method for that. Sorry. There's a reason the side of the box has those before/after pictures: if your base hair color isn't on the side as a \"before\" shade, then you're probably not getting anywhere  close  to the color on the box. Going that dramatically far from one shade to another means you're looking at a strong lightener, which is almost always bleach. You can do it at home (at your own risk) or see a professional with experience to do it for you. If seeing a pro isn't an option, or you refuse to bleach, then reconsider what shade you're trying to go to. \n She didn't believe me and walked out with the lightest shade of Garnier Fructis she could find on the shelf, telling me that her sister told her it worked for her so whatever.

One problem, however, is  that he tends to put his body weight into his chest when he's on top. And, as you can imagine, his chest is on  my  chest, usually right on my lungs. So here he is, gently telling me \"relax, you're too tight\", while I can barely breathe because his weight on my lungs.

Management will usually use that to cover the main dishes and a few drinks. Roughly every other person (1 in 2) will bring in at least something (potluck on a theme.) You aren't  expected  to bring anything in, as we all make crap for pay, but it's greatly appreciated by everyone when you do. \n There's this guy though. He's a negative person in general. He whines and complains all day long, and openly talks about how much he hates people, including those he works with. Customers have complained about his attitude. All of our managers hate him, but they don't have enough to fire him. \n Last month we had our potluck. As usual, grumpy gills brought nothing. While several of us (including a manager) were on our breaks in there, he walked in and surveyed the food. He then began complaining about the selection, and how there wasn't enough variety for him. He didn't like what people had brought. Then he walks over to a slow cooker, grabs a fork, and begins to eat directly out of it. There are stacks upon stacks of paper plates and cups, but no, he eats  right out of it . \n Needless to say, the manager that was there actually stood up and left the room. She was too furious to stay there and watch him. I told him to stop, but he made a face and said, \"right, like I care,\" and kept going. \n He's got an interview somewhere else sometime next week (\"and I'm not going to give two week's notice if I get it, fuck this place.\") Here's to hoping he gets the job so we can be rid of him.", "The summer immediately preceding my freshman year of college, I decided to take a \"summer start\" program for freshmen. You stayed on campus with a group of ~100 other freshmen and took a few classes in smaller class sizes. They weren't super srs bzns courses, mind you - just electives that gave you an advantage going in as a freshman. During this program we were of course encouraged to do all the cheesy icebreakers and friendship building. \n I became friends with my roommate, who turned out to be an extreme anime nerd and introvert. Through her I met a guy we'll call Bob. While my roommate initially wanted to go out and be socially active, hanging out as a trio, she quickly withdrew, leaving Bob and I to become friends. Now, I've always had a pretty decent gaydar, and Bob was no exception. He came out to me a week after we became friends, to no surprise. I was fine with it, of course, and relieved that I wouldn't have to worry about awkward sexual tension. He was a gay guy, I was a straight girl - what could possibly go wrong? Bob started dating one of our classmates (we'll call him Steve). Steve, Bob and I spent most of our free time together. We watched bad monster flicks and ghost hunters twice a week as a ritual - we'd get coffee after classes every Wednesday. Everything was peachy. \n Fall semester arrived. Bob and Steve were together for a while, then broke up in a mutually amicable way. We played video games over in Bob's dorm room (which he shared with several other guys) half the time and in mine (solo unit) the other half. But that's when things started getting -- for lack of a better term --  uncomfortable . Bob started asking to eat dinner with me more often in the dinner hall, and alone, as opposed to with Steve or other people. At first, I thought Steve was maybe busy, but as it turns out, he'd never been invited. Bob got a Sexy Truth or Dare app on his phone and begged Steve and I to play with him, and oddly fixated his questions and dares on me. I finally stopped him after he dared me to take off my shirt. He wanted to know anything and everything about my sexual activity, about anyone I was dating or even interested in. He \"didn't like\"  any  of the other guys I hung out with, and insisted that  he  was my #1 male friend. When I wanted to change clothes, he had to be firmly reminded to leave the room. He brooded for days when I studied (no, really - we  just  studied) with a guy from one of my classes. Of course, he insisted, he was  gay  - he didn't  really  care who I saw. \n The final straw came the one night I stayed over in his dorm. Now, I'd been a bit uncomfortable before this, but I figured I was just being paranoid. I didn't want to be  that  girl who read too much into innocent behavior. So when Bob invited Steve and I to stay overnight at his place and play video games, I figured it would be fine. Steve would be there anyway, and he at least had shown nothing but respect. So I brought over the essentials (pillow, PJs, toothbrush) and we settled in for a long night. But Steve got tired and decided to go back to his dorm. I tried to make an exit as well, but my dorm was clear across campus (a good 20 minute hike), and it was just past midnight. I wasn't going alone, so I stayed. \n The floor was concrete, and Bob had no spare blankets or anything, so we were stuck sharing a twin-sized bed. Bob informed me that he sleeps on the edge of the bed, and had me positioned against the wall. He also informs me -- as sheepishly as possible -- that if I feel something \"poke me\" during the night, it's completely unintentional, and I should ignore it. He turns the light out, and I settle in to sleep. Then he starts  talking.  He  tells me that his roommates have no idea that he's gay, and probably think we're having sex. I scoff at this and tell him he's being ridiculous. He suggests that we make \"sexy noises\" to anger his roommates. I decline, and tell him I just want to sleep. So he starts making them. Here he is, grunting and moaning next to me, when he begins to shake the bed against the wall. I tell him to stop - he keeps going. I say it more firmly, and more loudly - he tells me I'm being a spoil sport and continues, even more obnoxiously. I feel something, either his hand or the back of his hand, cup my breast. That's the final straw, and I yell at him, \" BOB, STOP. \" \n Silence. There's a knock on the door. I'm -- inexplicably, I guess -- crying at this point because I'm terrified of what he's going to do next. I crawl over Bob, grab my bag, which I thankfully kept packed with all my things, and get up. One of his roommates is at the door with a concerned look. \"Is everything ok?\" He asks me. I say nothing and throw my shoes on as I leave. I didn't see anything behind me, but from what I could hear, he -- thankfully -- stopped Bob from following me. \n I never spoke to Bob again. He called and texted me for weeks. I unfriended him on facebook, and he sent me messages anyway. He borrowed other peoples' phones when I blocked his number. He camped outside my dorm room several times before my RA began kicking him out on sight. I'll never know what happened - maybe it was just a joke, and maybe I took it too seriously. But it was too much, and I snapped.", "How did you become overweight?  I was delightfully skinny until third grade. I transferred schools to an advanced program ((which you usually do much earlier)). My stress immediately went up, even for that young, as did the amount of homework. I stopped going outside and running around for fun, instead staying inside and talking to friends. Slowly, over the next couple years, my activity levels went from very active to mostly sedentary. My family also didn't eat well. Sure, we had fresh food (my family is very well-off). But lean nutrition was a joke. I had free access to ice cream, cake, soda, sugary juice, whatever I wanted. Meals were mostly based around red meat, usually 4 nights a week, and we went out to dinner (almost always Chinese or Mexican) at least once a week. In terms of truly  healthy  meals, I'd say we ate healthy once, maybe twice a week. By the time I was in sixth grade, I was overweight. I went over the obese line by eighth. \n \n Did it seem to happen suddenly, or did it take years?  See above. I noticed feeling out of breath in third grade: we went to a doctor, they tested me briefly for asthma (test = making me run briefly in a circle in the office), and sent me on my way. I definitely started noticing it by fourth grade, but it didn't really hit me until fifth. I had to wear a bra by fifth grade. I started sucking in my stomach in fifth grade as well. I fully decided I was doomed to be a fat kid by seventh. \n \n Did you at any point try to reverse the process?  Several times. I know I had hit around 180 in eighth grade, so I immediately stopped eating ice cream ((I could easily eat half a carton in one sitting at that point)). I know I got down to around 150 just through that alone. But at that point, I was so overweight and so out of shape that exercise was brutal, so I couldn't bring it down any further. That's the lowest I've weighed since then. In high school I didn't explicitly diet, but I did rationalize to myself, \"ok, you can't eat that much, it's  really  bad for you\". A couple friends helped me exercise occasionally, and I took a gym class at least once a year. So that helped maintain it. However, as I've mentioned before, I haven't been able to get my weight below 150 since eighth grade. No amount of effort has shaved those pounds off. Late last year I peaked at 185 (right before I started losing weight: see #4). \n \n Are you trying to lose weight? If not, why? And if so, are you succeeding? Why or why not?  Incrementally. I've been watching what I eat since December, restricting sweets, getting off the soda, and watching meal portions. I've been getting 45~60 minutes of active exercise 3~5 days a week, and work in at least keeping moving (as opposed to being sedentary) the rest of the week. I'm down 20 pounds. I know I could lose more if I really pushed myself hard. But there's a lot going on in my life (family relationships, personal relationships, work, school, general stress, etc.) that makes just fighting the overwhelming habit of stuffing my face -- a stress habit I developed over years -- a daily willpower struggle, let alone working out. Currently I'm actually pretty fit (in terms of fitness) for my weight range. Even in high school, given the willpower, I could lap most of the other girls, stretch further than the skinny girls, and swim fast enough to merit innumerable invitations to join the swim team. That being said, I know my weight holds me back from being more fit than I am.

{"user_id": "AnyelevNokova", "subreddit": "breakingmom", "posts": ["Dude, we have it too! This bug is  nasty . \n SO felt sick Sunday. Came home from work early. Did the whole  I'm dying ,  I'm never doing anything ever again  song and dance. He said he had a headache and his stomach was bubbly. No diarrhea or vomiting, just really crampy. He was apparently well enough to play Diablo III all afternoon, laughing with his brothers, but still sick. I took care of the kid, ran errands, babied my partner, all that jazz. \n Monday rolls around and would you look at that, now  I'm  sick. SO has to go to work at 11. I'm still up and taking care of the kid basically by myself because  lol getting help with mommy duties, amiright?  10:25 I run to the bathroom at mach speed for my first (of five) puke of the day. I don't make it in the toilet thanks to that goddamn (lifesaver) toilet lock. I'm sitting in a massive pool of my own chunky vomit, it's all over the toilet lid, all over the floor, it's splashed up on the counters and on the sides of the tub... And as I'm puking left and right I have the dog and the screaming baby trying to push the door open to come in. I'm pushing back because god help me they  can't  be in here, but they're both barking/screaming nuclear meltdown  throwing themselves  against the door to get in. I scream my SO's name, he freaks out and starts yelling at me to calm the fuck down and just hand the baby to him.  I can't hand the baby to you, I'm puking my guts out!  And then what does he say, once I'm done hurling? I gate the bedroom off to keep the (still screaming) toddler out as I strip off my vomit-covered clothing and start searching for cleaning supplies. He says, \"I have to go to work. Dude, if you need me to leave early just say so.\" And then he leaves. I notice that the clock is 10:15; he doesn't have to leave for work until 10:30. \n Thanks a fucking lot. \n \n I don't even... I know that he doesn't handle vomit well. Honestly, I haven't met a single man that does. Every man I've known sees blood or vomit and instantly bails out. Believe it or not, this situation (me puking over and over again while baby cries over being \"abandoned\"; instead of helping me he leaves) has happened before  twice . I'm so freaking sick of being expected to suck it up. I'm going to do what I can, but damn it man. I need a  little  help here. My only saving grace was that when he let it slide when he came home and observed that our son trashed the apartment (I was basically toilet and couch-bound the entire day; standing up for more than a few minutes sent me to the toilet.)", "It's alright. Mine is keenly aware that Mother's Day exists. But the most he usually does for his mother is a card; you think I'm going to get jack shit? lololol. I've had presents set aside for  his  mother for weeks now; I know for a fact that he has done nothing and will likely do nothing other than call her at some point in the afternoon when someone reminds him what day it is. I've reminded him several times, but he (almost literally) sticks his head in the sand when it comes up. I'm actually tempted to go out in the desert (20 minute drive), fill up a pot with sand, bring it home, and  label  it, \"In Case Of Denial\" and put it next to his desk to use as necessary. \n He's going to stay up late the night before, sleep in, say maybe three words to me in the morning, then go to work. Business as usual. And if I'm at all upset or pouty, I get to hear, \"whaaaaaaaaaat? Why are you mad at me?  dramatic sigh  We can have an adult conversation about this.\" I'll state my feelings, then he'll tell me that I'm being overdramatic and making a big deal out of nothing. Then he'll come home, throw a box of on-sale chocolates he bought at his store at me, and go back to video games. Wow, don't hurt yourself trying to be thoughtful or anything. \n Last year I made a point of asking him if he wanted something for Father's Day. He said sure, that would be awesome. Guess what I got for Mother's Day?  Nothing. \n I'm not a huge fan of Hallmark holidays. I don't like forced, sappy shit. But damn it, man. If a shitty, consumerism-driven holiday driven by guilt is the only way I'm going to be  acknowledged , then I'll jump on the train.", "So I've mentioned here before that I am a SAHM (not by choice) and that my SO has been dragging his feet finding a new job. Now, to clarify the situation: he makes, take-home, about $1450 a month. His gross is high enough that we qualify for  nothing  assistance-wise, but after taxes and insurance, that's what we make. Period. Rent and the utilities they roll into that bill are $700/mo. and are due on the 1st, no exceptions; if you don't pay on the 1st, they start the eviction process on the 2nd. And we live in Arizona; as any other SW gals can testify, our electric bills  skyrocket  thanks to A/C. Last month's bill was $240, about 40% more than normal. \n I've known for several months now that we are running a deficit, especially thanks to summer. I've told my SO  many many MANY  times that we are running a deficit. We have no credit cards, no savings, no \"fall back\" sources of cash: when the bank hits $0.00, that's it. I've told him for MONTHS that we are about $200 behind. And he keeps saying oh, I know, it's fine, I'm working on it. He got his pharmacy tech license at the end of June and has been applying  one fucking job at a time . I told him not to do this; his mother told him not to do this; he fucking did it anyways. Because he's goddamn picky. He could have transferred within the company by now, but no, he wants to apply outside one at a fucking time. Meanwhile, I've been selling my childhood video games, my clothes, my laptop, even my fucking heirloom jewelry, just to scrape up extra cash to keep us afloat. I've told him dude, I'm running out of things to sell; what does he say? \"Just keep finding things.\" I can't. We are running out of things of value. He applied at a mail order pharmacy three weeks ago: knows several people at the company. He had the interview last Monday. They said they would get back to him Thursday/Friday. Well, he just called me from work: apparently that tech license  isn't even a license.  He went to the PTCB, he took his exam, he passed, he got a nice shiny certificate in the mail and an online copy, but it's  not the license he needs.  He has to fork over another $75 to get it  state  certified. Nobody told him this, he had no fucking clue. He says he's going to do it tonight. But that might be irrelevant because now he's been holding out hope on getting this job at the mail order pharmacy when they've probably checked his license and discovered that he's not technically certified and have disqualified him.  Then  he tells me, oh, well I only have $200 in the bank, but we get paid on Friday. \n Friday is the 29th. That $715 paycheck is going straight to rent. If he has to pay $75 out of the $200 we have, that leaves us $125 to go two weeks. Gas alone will eat up $50~60 of that. So... $75 for two weeks. And he eats like a fucking truck. Thankfully the little one doesn't eat that much, but my SO... I don't know where all those calories go. We have some food in the pantry, so we'll be ok for a while, but I don't know how long it's going to last. \n Anyway, back to the conversation. So after he tells me that he's going to have to fork over this cash (\"the company will reimburse me!\" '...WHEN?!') he then says, \"well, let's hope you get that job! You should call them tomorrow!\" I had an interview Friday at a law firm. I mailed them my application packed and a thank you card Saturday (should have arrived today or yesterday.) They said I should hear sometime this week. But fuck, I applied there before and it took half a century to hear anything that time (long story; they wanted me last time but did an internal transfer. I got the call this time because I was on the top of the resume pile.) And even if I get that job -- which, I'm not holding out hope -- it's a 9-5, which means we'd need daycare. The paycheck will offset that cost, of course, but that means actually receiving a paycheck, which will take a good 2~3 weeks. You have to pay daycare upfront. We don't have the money to do that, and unfortunately, \"I promise I'll have it in a few weeks\" doesn't cut it these days. So even if I GET the job, it won't mean diddly squat because we won't have any child care for the baby. \n We've asked his family for help before and his mom loaned us some money, but that was only a few months ago (April?) and I doubt they'd do it again. Fuck me. And just a couple days ago, he was asking me, \"will you kill me if I spend $18 on a video game?\"  to transfer his final fantasy character to another server.  Fuck dude. Maybe check your goddamn bank account before you spend $18 on a server transfer in case we're  broke . \n I'm going to go scrounging for more things to sell, but I'm running out of things that are actually worthwhile after S&H and all the fees and shit. I don't know what we're going to do. The management at our apartments absolutely will not take late or split payments. I can maybe get the electric bill split, but it won't fucking matter because that just means we'll be evicted  next  month instead of  this  month.", "OK. I NEED TO PUT MY SANCTIMOMMY HAT ON REAL QUICK, Y'ALL. \n WARNING: THIS POST MAY BE OFFENSIVE AND INSENSITIVE TO PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF KIDS. SORRY. \n So kiddo and I are at the playground today. It's like, 11 o'clock. Now, since the weather has been getting progressively nicer, all of these Mormon moms have been coming out of the woodwork and, like,  living  at the playground. Past three times we've gone there between 9 and noon, there have been 3~5 of them with their giant-ass broods of gatling-gun-cranked-out children. We're talking 4~6 children each. That adds up to anywhere from 12~20 kids on the playground all at once. And for whatever reason, almost all of them are boys. Not trying to judge -- if you want a big family, have a big family -- but holy crap, as a I-just-have-one parent, it's like going to another freaking planet. Kids everywhere. Kids screaming. Kids literally climbing up the swing sets, sitting on top of the water fountain, repeatedly flushing the toilets in the bathroom, throwing things off the picnic tables, hitting each other with scooters... I mean, seriously. It's been COMPLETE MAYHEM. And the moms are  walking versions of this picture \n But anyway. I digress. \n So we go to the park and it's 11 o'clock so ofc there are three Full Time Clown Car moms there. And just so you understand the layout of this whole situation, I drew you  this shitty paint diagram  So they're over there fussing around with one of their babies. They have the blanket out and they're all sitting around just laughing and talking and playing with the baby. Meanwhile, there are ELEVEN other children running around. I counted.  I used to work daycare, it's a habit.  ELEVEN kids, plus the baby. \n Anyway. So all of their other children are running around causing complete mayhem. There are two boys beating a tree with their scooter, another two that are climbing on top of the wall-attached water fountains by the bathrooms, one kid is trying to wrap a swing around the top of the structure... Just complete ruckus. And the moms are completely oblivious (or ambivalent.) Well, my kid goes to play on the large structure. He likes to go down the slides. So about ten, fifteen minutes pass. My kid is going down the long slide (on the right) and climbing back up. I'm standing next to it on the north side, just making sure that he doesn't do anything stupid and kill himself and that he plays well with others -- cause he's three and an only child and not currently in preschool. His social skills? Not great. He generally does ok, but we have issues with sharing and taking turns. \n That purple box on the map is a climbing wall. It's about seven, maaaybe eight feet up. My kid can climb it just fine. Anyway - at the top there's a big gap for, obviously, kids to pull themselves up. The rest of that area on the structure has those kid-safety big bars (a gap on the west side to go up/down the stairs to the rest of the structure; a funnel to go down the slide on the east side; south completely closed off; and a two ish  foot wide gap where the climbing wall attaches.) But yeah - big ass-hole in the bars. \n So there's this girl there that's maybe 2. I say  maybe  - she still looks kind of wobbly. Walking and running, sure, but not talking much at all and still holding onto things for balance. MAYBE two; my best guess is a little younger. Anyway. She's playing on the large structure, surrounded (I presume) by her brothers, who aren't paying any attention to her at all. And (presumably) her mother is one of the ones yapping away with the baby a solid 50+ feet away (and out of her line of sight.) So the girl climbs to the top of the structure and I notice her standing near the entrance to the big slide. My kid is playing just fine; she looks kind of alone. Then I see her step to the side. \n Well, instinct and experience tells me to watch her. So she steps to the side, I step to the side towards the base of the climbing wall, and sure enough, it happens - she leans out the hole at the top of the climbing wall and goes tumbling down. \n I caught her before she hit the ground. Not a suave catch -- it was more of an OH SHIT OMG OMG OMG diving catch -- but I caught her. She didn't cry - she just looked at me, completely baffled. She doesn't know me; I don't know her. I set her down and asked her if she was ok, she gave this pipsqueak of a \"yes\" and walked off. \n THE MOTHERS DIDN'T EVEN LOOK UP. \n Nobody saw this except for the other kids, who said nothing and continued playing. \n W.T.F. \n I may have just saved that child's life. I mean, she could have been fine. My kid got pushed down a set of stairs at that age and walked away with a mean looking cut that left a scar, but no  real  damage. But this is wood chips. This is seven feet, straight down. If she had landed on her neck... \n I didn't say anything. I should have, but I didn't. I wanted to march over there and cuss them out. If you're going to have four fucking kids, then fucking parent them. Having that many is not an excuse to sit in a corner and let them run completely wild. The playground is a  tool ; not a goddamn babysitter. Watch your damn kids.", "OP here]( for context. \n So I did a lot of mulling while [not] sleeping last night and decided on a plan that would work for everyone. In the morning, MIL ignored me. Again. She was snippy with kiddo which, to me, is a big line to cross: if you're mad at me, be mad at  me . Don't take it out on your grandchild. He's sitting there trying to get you to play puzzles with him and you're being mean to him. Classy. \n Anyway, she left for her doctor's appointment without saying a word. I had no clue when she'd be home - calendar said my BIL was working at 2, so I knew she'd be home before them, but once 10 rolled around, I assumed she'd gone out somewhere. \n So she comes home around 11 with bags in tow. I called down the hall to her as she walked by that one of her dogs had vomited twice in her office (with house layout, if it's there, I can't  not  see it when I walk by) and that I cleaned it up but she should keep an eye on him because it was a LOT. One of her other dogs had been copiously vomiting a couple days prior and it was the same deal, so I figured forewarning would help. \n She then started talking to me. She said ofc ewww at the dog and blah blah blah. Then she says, \"I'm going to see a therapist.\" \n Apparently she had several abnormal things on her blood panel at the dr, but then she opened up to him about her emotional state lately. She said, \"I don't know why I do that\" [scream and yell expletives and insults at us completely out of the blue over stupid shit or straight up having done nothing wrong.] She said her doctor refilled her ativan prescription (apparently she takes it 2~3x a week) and gave her a referral to a therapist, \"she's very nice, he says she's good.\" She said, \"with the divorce and my mom and feeling like I have to be over there all the time, but then feeling like I have to be over here too, I don't know.\" I carefully told her that it sounded like a good idea and that it'll be a safe place for her to talk and to maybe learn some coping strategies. \"Yeah, cause I, like... I vent to people but everyone's in the circle, y'know? I need someone outside of that. Someone neutral.\" She also looked at the calendar and said, \"hm, well, I don't think I want my first appointment until after my vacation. So... Maybe early October.\" \n Anyway. We are obviously still not OK, but we're speaking again, so it's something. She didn't say sorry or directly apologize, but she kind-of-sort-of came close. She sat in the living room with kiddo and put on a tv show for him. \n I texted DH that she was now speaking to me and that she said she's going to see a therapist. It was the magic fucking words for him. \n \"Are you sure you want to go through the with move then, if she's actually making an effort to improve?\" \n First of all, getting a referral means very little to me. STBX-stepFIL left her [again, to her joy] March last year. THEY STILL AREN'T DIVORCED. He mooches all of her money, ran up their credit cards, took money out of her bank account without her permission, uses her as a personal therapist and calls and calls and calls and calls incessantly until she answers, invites friends of his over to the house like it's his freaking flop house [he moved a state away about six months ago but still does this], refuses to get his crap out of here, refuses to get his own car insurance and phone service, is still costing her $300/mo for health insurance he refuses to pay for, and actually tried to log onto her buy-through-your-paycheck shopping account to buy himself a desktop computer WITHOUT TELLING HER. She found out when he called her asking for the password!! And yet, still not divorced. She says she should. She says it's overdue. Her tax lady  begged  her to get divorced asap because he emptied as much as he could of his 401k (again, without telling her) which made them owe $2k this year for the first time ever (and, you guessed it,  he's not helping her pay that either. ) She's had the free consultation with a tiger lawyer. Her mother literally handed her the check for the retainer. All she has to do is fill out a small mountain of paperwork and bam, she's got a kickass attorney and him by the balls because she filed first. THAT WAS A MONTH AGO. She  still  hasn't finished the paperwork. She has everything she needs for it - she's just too lazy to actually do it! \n So yeah. Her saying \"I'm going to go see a therapist\" means very little to me until she literally says \"I'm going to my therapist now\", leaves, and comes back two hours later saying, \"I had a wonderful time at my therapist, and here's what I have to say about it.\" And even then, even if she  does  go, who's to say she's actually going to improve? Lord knows plenty of people go once and never go back, or go and gain nothing out of it. \n And the decision to move -- while definitely triggered by her latest episode -- isn't only about her behavior. We've been talking about moving for over a year, and more seriously in the past few months. We have very few friends here, and those we do have consistently flake and bail out, so we actually don't hang out with anyone, ever. Family? His mother is unstable, his brother barely grunts at him if it's not over the internet, and he can only stand so much of his grandmother and great aunt. I have a cousin that just moved here but we really barely talk anyway - that's it. I haven't been near my family in six years. \n The weather is shit - it's hot, and we're both tired of being hot. I've been here for six years; I'm done with hot. I had a kidney stone for the first time ever (actually I technically had two, but the other one was relatively small at 2mm and I've probably passed it at this point. The 8mm one was the hospital stay), thanks to chronic dehydration from the fact that it's  fucking hot . I have other urinary/kidney issues that I've dealt with my whole life, so the urologist actually suggested that I might consider moving to a cooler climate to better manage my hydration (which may be BS, idk.) My allergies are out of control, as are kiddo's. The schools here are absolute shit unless you live in Rich People Land which we never will. Wages are low, which, while the cost of living is also kind-of low, for what we get, I don't think it's worth it. \n My family is willing to help us get on our feet. They will help us get an apartment. They will help me get through another leg of school (I just got my CNA license but would like to go for RN.) They will watch kiddo at the drop of a hat, as will my brother and his girlfriend. I have family all up and down that area - people who have literally said, give us kiddo and go on vacation whenever you want. NO ONE in his family has said that. When I was in the hospital for four days, MIL sulked for a  week  because she had to watch him for one whole day! And I'm just lonely. I moved here and stayed here because he didn't want to be apart from his family. Damn it, what about mine? I know it's selfish, but we stayed here because his friends and family were all here. It's been six years, and most of those people are gone. When is it my turn to be near my family?  When is it his turn to make a sacrifice for this relationship? Cause I've done it a lot. \n So I don't know. I told him I haven't changed my mind. If she's going to be chill, then I'm ok not flying to my parents tomorrow, but I'm not going to take her promises of change for anything more than promises. I'm glad it's more than the usual \"I'm sorry\" that I get [followed by her doing it again a week or two later], and if it helps her, good. But I can't trust her word anymore. He does, but I don't.  I'm just worried DH has changed his mind and is going to make me choose. I hate the idea of ultimatums, but damn it, he agreed to do this! What happened to \"this won't be a negotiation\" and \"it's the best for kiddo anyway\"? Are we really going to throw away our plans and the opportunities this move would provide us because she said she's going to go to therapy the next time it might be convenient for her? \n I don't know. I know DH will be grumpy when he gets home.

Of these 238 reported murders, 16 were in the United States. For those who aren't too good at arithmetic, for the \"1 in 12\" statistic to be accurate, there would have to be fewer than 200 trans people living in the US. This is, to put it mildly, several orders of magnitude below even the most conservative estimates made by most advocacy groups, which are in turn about a hundred times lower than those made by tumblr. The Williams Institute, for instance, [estimated in 2011]( that 0.3% of the population identified as trans. \n Yes, there's probably an underreporting bias. I'm sure a lot of morgues have processed John Does who would, had a necromancer been handy to ask them, rather have been Janes. But the thing is, wherever you're getting your numbers from,  it would have the same underreporting bias , so this doesn't really explain the discrepancy. \n For comparison,  there were 14,827 homicides in the US in 2012 , which you will also note is  way the fuck higher  than that \"1 in 18,000\" number quoted above. But the murder rate has dropped since then. [The most recent age-sorted data I could find was from 2010]( and up-to-date actuarial tables are surprisingly hard to find, but eyeballing it gets me somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1 in 280. \n What does this mean? If trans individuals are murdered at the baseline rate, and 1 in 333 people are trans, we would expect to see (14,827 / 333 = ~44) murders of trans people in the United States each year. If they were murdered at six times the baseline rate, as some advocacy groups have claimed, we would expect 267. If as tumblr claims, they were murdered at  1500  times the base rate, we'd see 66,000 (!). This mountain of corpses, more than four times the  total  US homicide rate, would be roughly equivalent to the death toll of the entire [Tet Offensive]( \n How many do we  actually  see? Sixteen. \n I'm not trying to minimize the horror of that. Any death is a tragedy. One murder is one murder too many. And the thing is... it's  tragic enough . You don't  need  to make up ridiculously inflated figures for shock value. You don't need to cheapen the loss of each of those sixteen people with your hyperbole. And as anyone from [Daniel Kahneman]( to [Josef Stalin]( will tell you,  even if people take your lies at face value  it's not actually going to help your cause. \n If all you care about is an excuse to continue feeling hateful and indignant, by all means, make up whatever numbers you want. But if your priorities include helping marginalized people  who have to live in reality , it might help you to spend a little more time there yourself. \n See Also : Christina Stephens [makes an effort to track down the origin of that bogus statistic here]( \n \n The human brain is really bad at comprehending numbers. I'm sure a lot of you still don't grasp quite what it means to be off by  three and a half orders of magnitude , so let me offer you an analogy: \n From January 1918 to December 1920, an H1N1 Influenza epidemic, nicknamed the \"[Spanish Flu]( killed somewhere between 50 million and 100 million people. It was one of the greatest natural disasters in history, up there with the Black Death. \n By using tumblr math, however, we can determine that it  actually  killed upwards of 316  BILLION  people. The world's population in 1920 was only about 1.86 billion, and most estimates for the number of humans who have ever lived are around 100 billion, thus proving (* [proving]( that the Spanish Flu was a  time virus* that killed everyone who has ever lived or ever will, and that the Earth is now a barren, lifeless wasteland.", "Hmm, let me see if I can make this argument in an SJW-friendly manner: \n The term \" genital mutilation , to making a single ritual prick that under normal circumstances heals fully with no lasting changes.

You take a risk when you don't leave out a bowl of milk at night to pacify hostile fairies- and even if you do, you're risking the wrath of fairies who are lactose intolerant. Just because you are bad at doing the calculations- and most human beings are very bad at it- does not change that that is what you are doing. \n There's a difference between reasonable risks and unreasonable risks- a teenager driving drunk is not equivalent to a professional driver, stone sober, on a route he has taken a thousand times before. The former is a behaviour we would like to discourage, whereas the latter is making all reasonable efforts to be safe. If the two collide, the law doesn't  treat them equally. Hospitals, however, do. There's no provision in the Hippocratic Oath excluding patients who have been reckless in the past- if you can help someone, you help them, full stop. \n When someone takes a reasonable risk, and it fucks them over, a sane society does its best to help them recover. It does not add insult to injury. If you are at a fancy restaurant and your date starts choking on her steak, when she knows full well that she could have ordered soup instead, you don't scream that she knew what she was getting into while watching her asphyxiate.

There might be something about these energy patterns that allows them to exert an influence on the sort of matter and energy the Standard Model deals with, thereby permitting the existence of phenomena we might describe as \"magic\".

And, therefore, if in some historically contingent circumstances, the evidence that I have available to me should turn against Christianity, I don\u2019t think that that controverts the witness of the Holy Spirit. In such a situation, I should regard that as simply a result of the contingent circumstances that I\u2019m in, and that if I were to pursue this with due diligence and with time, I would discover that in fact the evidence, if I could get the correct picture, would support exactly what the witness of the Holy Spirit tells me. \n Source: William Lane Craig, [ William Lane Craig - Dealing with Christian Doubt ](", "and really trying not to sound like an idiot here but if it doesnt become a fetus is it just flushed out during the menstual cycle ? \n Yes.

Even squatting hurt. \n In December, the doc diagnosed me with a mild SLAP lesion (didn't do MRI, just X-ray and exam) and said that my shoulder flexibility was so terrible, that he would never recommend surgery because it would decrease mobility even more. He sent me to PT and told me to suck it up and that when the pain becomes bad again, that I may need surgery. \n Fast forward to today. I've been doing rehab-like exercises for 2 months, and it's driving me crazy. Last night I squatted 5x5x175 (more than 100lbs shy of my last good set before injury which was 297.5x5x5) and it felt great to get back under the bar. \n For the sake of my shoulder, I am subbing DB Presses for the usual barbell press, as I can use a grip that doesn't aggrevate my shoulder. We'll see how Bench press goes. \n Many of you might not care, but I was downright giddy to get back under the bar.

Furthermore, pick order isn't completely representative of how heroes are used; as an example, with Bat and Wisp being the power heroes right now, Wisp has much more synergy and shapes game-flow much more than Bat does despite both being first pick-phase regulars. Thus it has more influence on the win rate, regardless of when they were picked.

I agree that manual choking of speed on hitting usage thresholds is a crude solution that is unacceptable to most users.

Right now, if one user paid for a 20 mbps LTE-quality service and moved to an area where the pipe provided is only 25 mbps of HSDPA because a total of 15mbps usage was expected from 15 long-term users in that area, would it be fair for 15 users to split on the remaining 5 mbps that they have constant use of? If the LTE-quality user suffers less loss-of-quality from having 10 mbps compared to 15 users having 1 mbps vs less than 400 kbps, then I as both a user and business owner would rather have a better value on having 15 satisfied customers versus 1. \n The above scenario is rendered moot if telcos expand their carrying capacity in all of their nodes and can temporarily over-provision heavier nodes across seasonal differences. I agree that infrastructure SHOULD be much better overall, but with the caveat that with that upgrade, that there should be more flexibility on a technical level to shape bandwidth provisioning both on wired and wireless. That is the only case I would agree with you where an FUP can be set aside completely, when the baseline infrastructure is large enough that large-scale temporary usage surges do not create choke-points in data flow.

Why, would you ask? It is because of two reasons: \n \n It was one of two places that could serve as a bottleneck to supply Japanese troops and harass Allied supply lines situated in the Central Pacific, and the other bottleneck; which was Formosa (Taiwan), was one of the most heavily garrisoned locations outside of China and Japan for the Imperial Japanese army as an annexed territory. \n \n For the same reason that the Japanese wanted the country as a staging point, it was also one of the most convenient locations to threaten two possible strategic thrusts: One option is an invasion of northern Indochina which would open up the Chinese to the full flow of supply of Allied materiel and link with the Burma theater; trapping troops in Thailand and the Malayan peninsula. The other is what eventually happened, which is the use of the Philippines as a full-blown staging area for a thrust straight north towards Japan itself. \n \n \n In any case, to make use of the Philippines as both a staging point and the final segment in cutting off naval access for the Japanese to the south, it would have been necessary to occupy Luzon, given the density of defenses that any strike further north would encounter if they had instead chosen to occupy Mindoro, Negros, Cebu and Leyte without committing to securing Luzon. This is why the Japanese went all-in at the Leyte Gulf battle, because allowing a landing in Leyte would make it extremely easy to force a landing in Lingayen Gulf, instead of having to stage from the Marianas. Allowing that landing would make it impossible for the Japanese to strike at them, as land-based air cover on Leyte by that time would assist naval assets in repelling a Japanese strike. \n In any case, because of strategic circumstances, and Japanese cultural attitudes (Bushido code/\"no surrender\" policy), an invasion was necessary. However, isolating Manila and starving it out was never an option in securing Luzon, as Manila Bay would have been unusable as a staging point without it. \n Note: I have not considered the issue of resistance fighters in-country even though they played a major factor is rendering large swaths of territory clear of Japanese personnel during the liberation, as they were a factor in actually moving forward with an invasion as well.", "Developer kicks dog to simulate ball physics in indie NFL Field Goal simulation would be a strangely appropriate parallel. \n It also shows in their business decisions.

I was also told by each representative that no sales tax was due on the service if no physical product changes hands. \n But that only works for family shoots and shoots for headshots, etc.  With weddings, we always charge sales tax, even if their package includes no products, because who knows if they'll buy an album down the road?

And was exporting and backing up while I went and fell asleep on the couch watching the original Django.", "I read your comment this morning on my phone, and decided to think it over a bit.  And I agree and disagree.  My statement may have been judgmental and a little harsh, and I didn't mean it to be.  I just spent a ton of time typing out that long post, and I think by the end I was tired and short.  Sorry about that. \n My average wedding delivery is somewhere from 600-800 images.  I can fully cull and edit a wedding of that size in somewhere around the 3-5 hour range, at most, including light skin touche ups (but by no means a full photoshop touch-up sort of thing).  I shot a wedding at the end of March that ended at 10:30pm Friday night.  I physically handed a thumbdrive to my clients on Sunday at 3pm before they hopped a plain to Costa Rica with over 900 images. \n It is unnecessary to take so long to edit photos.  Now I understand that some people use CS or Camera Raw or Aperture or whatever else to edit their photos.  For me, LR4 works best.  It's fast, and I can batch edit and batch color correct.  Some computers aren't fast enough to run LR, and I get that.  So that's one reason for slower editing. \n The question is, first, why would someone want to spend that long editing?  They're losing time with friends and family.  I, personally, am not okay with that.  So I spent most of 2011 and a good chunk of 2012 getting my editing time down to a minimum.  Less time spent working means more time with my family and less stress.  I like that. \n The second question is, if you're shooting an average wedding, you have 1 hour of drive time, 8 hours of shooting, 1 hour of drive time, 1-2 hours of offloading cards, backing up.  Now you're in for 12 hours.  With an average 40 hour work week being the most that people can spend working before they feel \"burnt out\", you now only allow yourself 28 hours to edit.  If you're taking 40 hours to edit, now you're at 52 hours of work.  Not including emailing clients, phone calls, meetings, delivering, blogging, website upkeep, book keeping, etc. \n With that said, at that pace, if you ONLY had 2 weddings a month, you're essentially at your 40 hour a week limit, and 24 weddings seems on the low-side of average for wedding photographers, and depending on your pricing, you may not have enough to survive on. \n Laziness comes in many forms.  Laziness to do that work (procrastinating - going out fishing and skateboarding instead of working), and laziness to build up techniques and skills that save you time (and, hence, money) in the future. \n I do know that some people hold their delivery dates to build suspense.  That I COMPLETELY understand. \n I hope I explained myself.  I just don't think a 40 hour editing schedule is workable and sustainable to also have a life outside of photography.  So I try to avoid it.  Nothing against someone who makes it work for them, but it's not for me.", "Posted this before, but here you go: \n This is going to be a down and dirty description, so bear with me as to the choppy-ness of how this all took place. \n Friend takes picture of me and my g/f on the couch.

It gave some rather unique opportunities like drastically upgrading the tech of the enemies between each game without losing the cohesion of the game world. But everything I have seen from the games, especially the last 3 releases, shows me that they haven't really done that. They are sticking to the tried and true and are barely making any changes. As an example: How come the enemies in AC3 so willingly go into melee combat when they have goddamn riffles? Because that\u2019s the kind of combat AC always had, so we have to keep it in right? \n Why did we end up with an AC franchise that plays it safe instead of playing it awesome? Imagine for instance that AC1 remains the same, in AC2 we move to Edzio's story and guns are introduced. Riflemen with these incredibly powerful weapons with crazy reload times. You have to be extremely careful around them because one or two hits can kill you, the gameplay changes because here is an enemy where you are FORCED to be sneaky or risk getting easily picked off. AC3 we are in the revolution, guns are quite frequent now, they are still powerful as all hell (I mean they are guns) and now their reload times are less insane and the training of the soldiers means that facing down multiple enemies result in them forming a firing squad and pumping you full of lead. Now you have to pick people off one by one to stand a chance, or utilize more diversions and mass takeout moves. Introduce a net you can throw over an area to stop soldiers from firing while they struggle, allowing you precious time to escape or take out whoever you are fighting. \n AC4 We are now where and when? Prohibition Era New York, dealing with the gangsters and mob bosses of the thirties. Guns are everywhere and Assasins have to adapt to the fact that everyone can be lethal with guns this advanced. You introduce dynamite sticks to throw and with a little help from DICE we are now rocking destructible environments we can use, so we use the dynamite to blow our way to our targets or blow down the wall to cover our escape. You add car chases and liquor runs as you are working with the mob against the Templar (government) bringing in booze and taking down rival mobsters who are working with the templar. Tell me you don't want to do the mission where you are finding and assassinating Al Capones book keeper to get the numbers that land him in jail with the help of the few assassins on the inside of the government. Or run a few drops for Bonnie and Clyde before eventually being forced to track them down and kill them? \n AC5 is when Desmond finally takes the stage and we get to truly explore his world where every enemy is templar trained and extremely dangerous. Gone are the days of fighting 10 enemies at a time and now just spotting 2 enemies together is frightening as they are well armed and well trained to take out anyone who comes their way. Every fight becomes a fight for your life and with Tasers and hand pistols just one misstep can be all it takes to kill you. You are forced to remain elusive and pick your battles against enemies you can no longer stealth assassinate as easily, even if you do sneak up on them you can only wound them through their Kevlar reinforced clothing giving you an easier fight. This means that you have to spend your poison to kill someone silently as the strong poison of this day and age can kill someone quickly. You have to choose who you fight and who you kill with poison due to a limited supply of poison and with the enemies calling for help while you fight them you have to make sure you only fight when far away from other enemies to minimize the risk of an enemy hearing the call for help and coming to kill you. You get better equipment to match the task at hand though, a small silenced gun allows you to take down opponents with well placed headshots, the small size means it can be hidden and explains why you have a small amount of bullets for it. Maybe you get a grabbling hook to climb buildings batman style to better cope with the tall blank buildings of this age. \n Do you people see what happened here? The game evolved, by slowly changing the enemies capabilities we changed the playstyle of the game without sacrificing the core of the experience. Slowly adding more lethality to the enemies while reducing the amount of them to keep the dificulty curve from spiking and all without breaking the logic of the world. Of course there are less gangsters or policemen to fight in the 30's than soldiers in AC3 or the holy lands. Policemen operate in small squads or pairs not in big regiments and the highly trained Templar operatives of Desmond's world are individual super soldiers (for lack of a better word) so why would they need to operate in groups? \n And really that's what saddens me, Assassins Creed could have been a pinacle in how a game franchise is built and kept fresh for years to come. Instead it just became a safe franchise release good safe games to a market of consumers that doesn't buy anything we cant recognize and then complain when we are given the same shit every year.", "So I recently gifted my loved one a DS and Pokemon Black 2 and as a [Mareep]( was caught I came up with a Nickname for it, I myself thought was pretty clever, calling it Android. \n So basically have you come up with any Pokemon nicknames you think are clever, then lets hear them and lets see if the rest of us can figure out why they are clever.

I know that the reason Zuko cant learn lightning bending is the whole inner conflict and all that, and I have heard all the logical reasons why it would be more accessible to everyone else in Korra. But as much as I like being all logical and stuff I really cant bring myself to think that it matters. \n To me there is just a single fact that really matters: They took what was the most powerful bending in AtlA and they made it a menial task anyone can do. I dont really care if it fits with the industrial theme. I cant really think of any supremely good reason they shouldnt know lightning bending. And I do get why lightning bending is used as it is in an industrial society. \n But for all the good reasons, all the logic, all the sense it makes. It still makes my stomach turn, because they took what we all believed was powerful bending, something 2 people in all of AtlA was capable of, the most powerful firebenders that were seen, and they made it a common day occurance. It spits in the face of Zuko who was unable to learn it, inner turmoil or no, because I refuse to believe that every person working a factory job is at peace with themselves. I dont know if you know a lot of factory workers, but they are not exactly the most zen bunch you are going to run into.", "Too long... actually read it anyway. \n You make a lot of good points and make a hell of a lot of sense, I will submit that the cheapening of lightning bending ties in with the modernization theme. Something that had actually crossed my mind but I neglected to mention because, well, it is easier to critizise if you arent throwing roses alongside the rotten fruit. \n Before I forget I dont believe my argument was... argumentum ad pulum (that is some fancy shit right there) because this was not a case of the study of fact. If I was saying: This show is bad because people dont like it, it would be wrong. But I was talking about feelings, and feelings can really only be measured in how many people feel them and how strongly they do so. So in fact there is no other way to \"measure\" this a lot of people feel lightningbending is cheapened, that is not thrown out there as a stamp of quality or fact. It is being thrown out there to make a point about the general concensus of the viewers. How on gods green earth (which really should be gods blue earth when I think about it) should I try to quantify this feeling if not this way? \n Though I will concede that on second thought I shouldnt have brought it up at all as it was a defensive maneuver used before a real offensive maneuver was brought against the argument. As a suspect stating his alibi before being asked for it I was lowering the credibility of my argument.", "I rather prefer style it is going for now, the thing about making the powers able to do stuff like that is that every fight becomes nothing but those moves. Why would I throw water at you if I can dry you out? Why would I airbend slice you if I can suffocate you? Literally the same with the 2 others as well. We already have this problem with blood bending, a guy learns blood bending: no reason to fight using anything else because of how stupidly powerful it is. Yeah it is cool for a villain but image a main character realizing: \"oh I can just suffocate my enemies, guess what I am doing every fight for the rest of the show.\" \n If you really wanna do an adult version yeah you can but dont do it by making the powers boring, keep the powers as they are but make them react more realistically with who they hit. If you take a rock to the face your bloody skull is gonna crack, if you get hit by a pillar of flame you are gonna get serious burn damage, that kind of stuff. \n There is a way to do Avatar more \"adult\" but it isnt how you suggest it, and even if it was done right, keeping the powers balanced and interesting, I personally believe it would be a weaker show for it. Hell even if we go all One Piece on it and have the blood fly and people fight on on pure willpower I think the show would be poorer than it is now (and for the record I LOVE OP) Avatar has a charm to how it blends the serious with the funny, and if you make bending that much more viscerally dangerous then I will be rooting for the equalists to be honest. How the hell are you gonna convince me the avatar is trying to restore peace and balance while suffocating someone? and if you go the: \"oh the avatar is the only one not being brutal\" then how the hell are you gonna make it seem plausible the avatar is gonna win? And once you have had your first bad guy show off how badass his bending can kill someone, how do you prove the next villain is badass? Have him kill someone more? \n The limitations of being an all ages show has made Avatar far greater than the freedom to be bloody would and I am disappointed by the fact that so many people think that if we just made this \"more mature\" it would somehow be better.", "We all know what the AtlA series tell us, it is right there in the first few episodes, the fire nation wiped out the Airnomads. How could they do something like that? Well later in the show we learn that they claim to have utilized Sozins comet to wipe them out but there is a hole in this theory. How does a nation with shaky ties to its neighbors set up its army in 4 remote locations without it being discovered and crushed by the earth Kingdom or the Water tribe for example? The air temples were far apart and marching a firenation army through the earth kingdom is bound to cause some problems. \n So if I claim the Firenation DIDN\u2019T wipe out the air nomads, what do I claim happened? Well it is obvious that they were involved with the genocide that took place as we find dead fire nation soldiers in one of the air temples. BUT, and this is the important part, they had help, Momo. \n Now I know what you are thinking: Glitch King, that is just downright silly. I know it seems that way at first but there are a lot of small hints to this having happened hidden throughout the show. The one most easily noticed and often mentioned is the interest King Bumi takes in Momo. King Bumi speaks for the white Lotus when he is horrified by the fact that Momo is missing, not till he realizes that the Avatar is still with him does he calm down. This reveals a lot about Momo and why the monster known as Momo did not lay waste to the Gaang when they arrived at the Air Temple and met him. \n Before we get into the show anymore lets talk about what has been dubbed Momo\u2019s Reign of terror. During the beginning of the of the war Sozin realized he needed to take out the Air Nomads before the Avatar could become fully realized, he also realized that marching his armies to each of the air temples would be impossible. Instead he decided to send small battalions of soldiers to each temple alongside the single greatest weapon the Firenation had against the Air nomads, the terrible Momo. \n The Firenation first took care of the Northern, Eastern, and Western air temples alongside Momo, how do I know these temples were attacked first? I will explain that a little bit later as it all becomes clear soon. \n The Southern Air Temple was, according to Aang, only accessible by Sky Bison, so how could the Firenation get to them? They had inside help through Momo, Momo used his connection with the Sky bisons to smuggle the air nation soldiers into the air temple. We have seen the aftermath of the battle with bodies from both sides littered around, but when you think about it: That doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. In the 3 other temples there were little to no evidence of the fighting, the bodies had been cleared out and such. So what stopped the Firenation from cleaning up and taking back their dead in the southern air temple? Well if you think about it becomes pretty clear that there is only one thing left in the Southern Airtemple that could have stopped them: Momo. \n So what happened that made Momo turn on the firenation during the last siege? We don\u2019t know but seeing how it is where the Avatar spent most of his childhood and where we have seen a lot of activity from the Avatar spirit. With The Avatar spirit gaining control of Momo he may have turned on the Firenation and with Momo standing between them and retrieving the dead the firenation decided to cut their losses and leave. \n Since that day no one disturbed the dead in the airtemple, because if those who tried were met by Momo\u2019s wrath. This also shows that the southern air temple was attacked last as the Fire nation was able to retrieve their dead without the interference of Momo. When the Gaang arrive Momo slowly enters the Avatar room as terror incarnate but when he feels the avatar spirit he is calmed. Now that the Avatar spirit is awoken within Aang Momo goes with him as the avatar spirit calms and controls the terrible Momo\u2019s temper. \n During the first part of their travels no one seems to care about Momo until the Gaang meets Bumi who, being over 100 years old, knows who Momo is and what he has done. After this meeting Sokka suddenly starts taking a far larger interest in where Momo is, even being shocked when he thought Appa had eaten Momo and avenged his brothers. This also explains why, when Bumi meets the gang without Aang and Momo he is relaxed when he realizes they are still together, the avatar spirit able to calm Momo. \n So now you know the truth of Momo\u2019s Reign of terror, let me know if you find other evidence to support this theory as there is a lot hidden in the show.", "Korra having difficulty learning the spiritual element of bending might be tied to how her training differed from the rest of the avatars.

Different factors such as the humidity of the air, the amount of heat in the barrel and the direction of the wind may determine whether the shell falls 30 or even 100 meters from the spot at which it was aimed.

In return, Israel would allow the Palestinians to the use a highway in the Negev to connect the West Bank with Gaza. In the Israeli proposal, the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be linked by an elevated highway and an elevated railroad running through the Negev, ensuring safe and free passage for Palestinians.

I got into gaming with my SO about 5 years ago. I try to stay out of vent. Unsolicited, I have been: \n *shown pictures of dicks. \n *I've had a guy inexplicably move his bed into his living room, then skype me to 'ask me if it looks retarded' then proceed to masturbate on said bed. \n *I've been asked if my 'pussy smells like tuna' so many goddamned times. \n *I've been shrieked at to 'SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN' in the middle of raids/matches. \n *And my favorite: A very serious proposal to move in with a 15 year old guy and maybe get married after defeating him in a duel at level 15 in world of warcraft (and that was enough of that game for me). \n *I've had really strange lonely college boys come up behind me in the union and ask me all about what the fuck i'm doing. i'm playing a goddamned video game go the fuck away. \n END OF EXAMPLES BEGINNING OF STORY TIME \n And you know what? It's made me a little wary of people. Recently, I've been involved with SWTOR. The pvp in this game is a riot. Anyway, I started out on one server and pugged a few matches and raids. \n This one guy was very overly friendly and went way out of his way to invite me to stuff. I'm not a bad player, and there's a large older player base that's generally friendly. Anyway, my polite acquaintance of occasional premades eventually degraded into this gentleman constantly whispering me whenever I logged on and increasing pressure to leave my guild to join his. Our acquaintance ended when he discovered that the tank we were constantly grouping with was, in fact, my soon-to-be husband. I could hear him almost crying on vent talking about how stuff doesn't work out for him and he has all these issues and how he used to be abused as a kid. It was pretty sad, actually, and we let him pour his heart out because it seemed like he needed to talk. But we were careful that my SO was the only person to invite him to our raids after that and I carefully distanced myself. It was clear this made him very sad. \n Anyway so SWTOR is apparently managed by two writers who have heard of game developers, but have never actually seen them and assume that they operate on the same schedule as the starwars universe they pen (as in stuff happens once every 2000 years). And their developers are actually cats being herded by a few key people. \n So we all had to change servers. \n I ended up on Jung-ma. This is the tiniest server. I decide to give the Empire side of the game a turn. I pug a few battlegrounds, get invited to a levelling guild that has a decent pvp base. I am generally enjoying kicking other players in the nuts. Literally, there is a nut-kick move in the game. It makes the best sound. Weekend at Bernie's anyone? \n So I'm talking on vent with these guys and over the last weekend during our matches I get pulled into another channel in vent. It's some guy who says the guild leader says I wasn't registered in vent and needs to give me a short interview. That's cool, little peeved its in the middle of a match, but I got it out of the way in about 20 minutes. \n The next day I'm pvping again with the same group of guys. They're great. They're older and learning how to use hotkeys and are very very funny. And I get pulled again into a moderation room. It's the guild leader. Can you guess who it is? It's our little friend from before. And he's SUPER EXCITED I'm in the guild. And that's cool. He's actually not a bad guild leader. But this motherfucker pulls me out of vent 6 fucking times in an hour to 'talk'. Starting from 'here is our guild motto and all the things I'm planning for the guild' and eventually spiralling into 'oh hey I didn't mean to be bothering you all the time but.... (goes into 40 minute talk about his cat's diabetes).... and then pesters me nonstop after I change back to the people I'm playing with asking if 'I'm mad' or 'Why won't you talk to me'. I just talked to you for an hour, man. I am trying to kick some internet robots in their imaginary nuts and I need to talk to some 50 year old hecklers about it. \n The conclusion is that apparently he does this with EVERY woman he finds in the game.

Hyenas, bulldogs, and greyhounds are all \"kinds\" of dogs. Chickadees, finches and bluejays are \"kinds\" of birds. \n > It's a simple matter of definition of the term \"scientific theory\". It's interesting you mentioned plate tectonics because that's also a scientific theory. Same with gravity, germ theory, etc. All the same scientific theories. \n Yes, but I have people literally say to me that the \"Theory of Evolution\" is no longer to be considered a \"theory\" in the same sense of any other scientific theory, but it should be considered proven fact (such as the \"theory\" of gravity). \n This of course is complete hogwash. No one to my knowledge debates gravity. We might argue about HOW it works, but the fact remains that gravity just ... is. It is experimentally proven by the scientific method, and repeatable consistently. Gravity is as certain as calculus. \n Evolution, on the other hand, is not repeatable by experimentation. We cannot \"experiment\" with millions of years. We just have to take it on FAITH that is what happened. \n And here's the rub. The theory of evolution (Darwin's theory) is just as much a system of \"faith\" as is religion. To some people, it IS a religion, and they cannot be convinced otherwise, just as much as I cannot be convinced otherwise, regardless of any supporting evidence. Trust me, I have had numerous debates on the topic. \n > Where did the Original Life come from \n > > Someone must already have told you that evolution doesn't deal with abiogenesis. Evolution simply explains what happens to life after it already exists, how it grows, changes, and develops over time. \n But you see, abiogenesis IS part of evolutionary theory, loud cries denying it to the contrary. Pick up any suitably elementary school text book, and look under the section that discusses evolution, biology, etc., and inevitably you will find a graphic account of the experiment (long disproved) regarding the \"chemical soup\" we came from (in order to explain the existence of original single-celled organisms). Textbooks NEVER start with the middle of the process...as it would create too many open questions for tiny, non-critical minds. \n Now you and I, several years down the road, may be able to differentiate between abiogenesis (life from non-life) and Charles Darwin's theory ... but when put into a classroom setting (where children's first exposures happen) and it's a totally different story. \n A child asks, \"But where did the animals and plants come from?\" The teacher is then hoisted on their own petard, as it were, because they have to either go with the politically correct answer of life from non-life, or Creation/ID. There is no \"third\" option.", "If you saw how little I own, you might not want to ask that question. \n It's true that God is calling us to a non-material existence (i.e. more like that in Heaven, where \"things\" don't matter at all). \n However, practically-speaking, it is IMPOSSIBLE to live without \"things\". We all need basic necessities just to live: clothes, food, shelter, transportation, perhaps. Besides, God said, \"[I] will supply all your needs...\" (Phil 4:19) If God wanted us to have NOTHING then He would have nothing to supply to us. Does that make sense? In other words, why promise to provide us with our Earthly needs, if we were just going to \"sell all we had\" anyway? \n And there is a particular problem for fathers and mothers who have families. Did Jesus really mean for us to sell everything, and sentence our children to abject poverty? Maybe some are called to that, and it would take a stupendous amount of faith...but I think by and large, that would be an irresponsible course of action. \n So what did Jesus mean when He spoke to the rich young ruler? Obviously, his wealth was his \"god\" (his master, the one that was ruling his life). In telling him to \"sell all he had and give to the poor\" it struck at the very heart of what kept him separated from God, and he had to make a choice: God, or money. (Because he went away sad, we can conclude which choice he made...) \n Two points here, and I won't bother you anymore on the subject: \n 1) Jesus did not tell EVERYONE to sell all their possessions. It was not a command for everyone. He was only talking to the rich young ruler. Surely you can see the logic in this. If everyone sold everything, then everyone would have nothing, and it would be self-defeating, logically-speaking. \n 2) The real point here is this: Who is the God of our life? It can't be money, or possessions, or sex, or power, or popularity, or anything in this life. Only God should be in a position to be in control. Once 'things' control you, and consume your time...then they de facto become your \"god\". And we call that \"idolatry\". \n It's about a heart attitude. You can be poor physically, but very rich, spiritually. But you can also be very rich in this world, yet very poor spiritually-speaking. \n Our family is \"poor as church mice\" as the saying goes. My car is about 30 years old, and my wife's is about 20. She works full time, and I am unemployed. But we still find time to volunteer at the soup kitchen a couple of times a week, and our kids don't do without (too much, anyway). I think we have struck a good balance between living \"impoverished\" in the world (which can draw undue attention) and in the opposite extreme being so focused on money that every decision is geared towards your balance sheet.", "I didn't say it...God said it: \n Romans 1:26-32 NIV (but you can use whichever translation you choose): \n > 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. 28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 32  Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. \n I want you to notice, though, that this statement comes at the end of a long list of transgressions of God's law, which includes, but is not limited to: idolatry (putting something, or someone else in the place of God), greed, lust, murder, envy (wanting someone else's possessions over your own), strife, deceit, and malice. \n What he is essentially saying, is that people want to go their own way, instead of going God's way. But the end of that road leads to destruction and death (separation). We see it all the time in the real world. It's what causes infighting and divorces...when someone demands their own way over what is right and good. \n Yes, it's a strong statement...but I want you to try to understand that God first holds out his open palm of grace (unmerited favor...you didn't work for it, you can't earn it, you can't deny it or get rid of it). God holds out his open palm of Grace first. But we spit in His face, and trample on His gifts of Life and Love and Peace....we as humans don't put up with much of that in the real world. \n Think about it: What would you do in this case? It's Christmas Morning, and you work all year, saving, and purchase a nice, new car for someone that you love. It's sitting out front with a big red bow, and keys in the ignition. You bring them outside, and go: \"Ta Daaa!\" They look at you, they look at the car, then they get a couple of gallons of gasoline, and burn it right where it sits, having never driven it. \n How would you feel? Pissed? Go ahead...it would be the right emotion. It's that same heart of ingratitude to God that breaks His heart daily. He gives us so much...and for the most part all He asks for is for us to \"Love the Lord Our God with all our hearts, souls, minds and strength, and our neighbor as ourselves.\" (Jesus said that, not Paul, BTW)", "I believe there are a few reasons why this is a fact. \n At least part of the problem is due to \"semantics\", or defining the terms. Evolutionists are slippery in this way, because they use the same term (evolution) to talk about \"adaptation\" (which as I said is provable, measurable, and repeatable science), and then switch gears and use the same word (evolution) when talking about  Darwit's  Darwin's Theory (sorry, typo). The two ideas do not logically follow, loud cries to the contrary. Just because we find some dinosaur bones, the only thing that proves is: that some rather large animals used to live on Earth. ANYTHING PAST THAT is pure speculation, and connecting the dots. I submit that scientists can, and do, \"connect the dots\" wrongly, because of a couple of reasons: \n 1) Darwin's Theory is popular. In other words, it goes against the grain to believe or teach anything remotely opposing to Darwin's Theory. Those who even suggest that there might be another logical alternative to Darwin are summarily laughed out of their jobs. There is immense peer-pressure involved here. In order to be perceived as \"educated\", one must bow before the sacred cow of Darwinism, or be \"cast outside the camp\". \n FYI, popularity is no gauge of TRUTH. \n Why do you think ID has such a hard time being accepted as a potential opposing theory? It's not because it's not logical, or doesn't answer the same theoretical questions...it's because Darwinism is as much as religion as Buddhism, and to go against the grain is to risk your entire livelihood. \n And it is an iterative process. Once the institutes of higher learning demonstrate forcefully enough that Darwinism is the only \"accepted\" theory, you can bet your last dollar that everyone with a dog in the fight will be on the bandwagon, even against their own logic or intuition. Once the teachers and academicians are all on board, the students are a given, because the students will only parrot what the instructors say, because their grades (and their potential livelihood) depend on it. \n If you don't think that what I am saying is the truth...try it out for yourself. Call it an experiment. In your next biology class, try to bring up [some divergent piece of evidence]( in support of intelligent design. Pick something, there is plenty. Since it is academics, surely your instructor will be welcoming of new and different ideas, and the entire class will revel in your intellectual rigor. Hogwash. Don't make me puke. You will be laughed out of the classroom, and anyone who even had questions will be silenced as a warning. Such is the \"intellectual rigor\" of today's biology classes. One side of the story is all that is tolerated. \n 2) Because Darwinism de facto excludes God from the equation, and is a humanist set of beliefs, it makes it a lot more palatable for people to swallow (at least those who choose not to believe in a creator God). Science seeks to determine natural processes for how things in this world work. Unfortunately, at some point this very logical thought breaks down, in that there are a few instances in human existence where science is not adequate to explain: 1) The origin of the universe, 2) The origin of life, 3) the origins of logic and laws of nature, and 4) The resurrection from the dead of Jesus (or any miracle, for that matter). Because there are times when God sovereignly invades the natural with the supernatural, there will be no natural explanation, try as we might. \n Science HAS no explanation regarding how life came from non-life, or how the laws of nature are consistent no matter our plane of reference, or even how the universe \"came to be\". Sure there are some very well thought-out theories, which can explain segments of reality...but have you ever noticed that the more a humanistic theory is developed, the more problems with the theory seem to arise? It's like Godel's Incompleteness Theorem in action: The more a theory (such as Darwinism) seeks to explain, the deeper the rabbit hole goes. And such will be the fate of every humanistic theory, which seeks to exclude God a priori. \n \"The first drink from the cup of natural science brings atheism, but at the bottom of the cup waits God.\" \u2013 Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976)", "Two things: \n 1) Darwin's Theory is popular.

{"user_id": "mswilso", "subreddit": "Christianity", "posts": ["Jesus didn't heal people for the sake of their body (every physical body will perish), but instead He healed them for their soul's sake. The gospel changes lives independently of the body. \n If I read this correctly (forgive me if I took this out of context), you need to seriously consider your line of reasoning here. To me, this sounds dangerously close to Gnosticism, which teaches that what is done in the body has no effect on the spirit or soul, and is one of the primary reasons Paul wrote to the Colossians. \n If what you are saying is true (that physical healing is of little value to the kingdom), then why did Jesus devote so much time to it? (Healing, feeding people, caring for the distressed, etc.) Yes, He taught, but it seemed to me that as He taught, He saw their base needs, and that was the spring-board to seeing that their deeper needs were met. \n I don't think I have this quote quite right, but I believe William Booth once said something to the tune of, \"Preaching is all right, but they will never hear your message above the growling of their bellies.\" \n And honestly, I believe that the healing ministries were at the very least an extension of the preaching of the Kingdom. Jesus is Lord of Heaven and EARTH. Not just the future, someday, pie-in-the-sky, but right here and now on Earth. When He came to preach the kingdom, He also demonstrated His Lordship over more than just the spirit realm, but also the physical realm: sickness, disease, the wind and rain...all of that was proclamation that He Is Lord of the Kingdom. \n Forgive me for the long response. I came out of the Southern Baptists not long after a pastor said to me, \"It's impossible to drink alcohol, and stay filled with the Holy Spirit.\" (Ironically, the SA is a tee-totaling group, but for a different reason...) So in reality, the SB belief is that actions in the body (such as drinking, dancing, what you watch on TV or internet) greatly affect the person's spirit. Taken to its logical conclusion, even abortion (a mainstay of Christian Conservatism) is an act done in the body, which we believe harms the spirit. But Jesus is Lord of even those things.  Jesus, through healing multitudes, demonstrated that He can not only heal spiritual and emotional scarring, but He responds to physical needs as well. He truly is \"Lord of All\".", "I think this is just a basic re-telling of what has already been said here, but this is how I understand the matter. \n Through Jesus' self-sacrificial death, God's infinite Justice was satisfied. (Colossians 2:13, \"When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins.\") Now, after the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, the issue is no longer Sin (per se) but rather what relationship we have with the risen Christ. Jesus says (Matt. 7:22-23), \"Many will say to me on that day, \u2018Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?\u2019 Then I will tell them plainly, \u2018I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!\u2019\" \n Notice the emphasis is on the fact that \"He never knew them,\" not on the fact that they did evil acts (though that is not entirely ignored, either.) The issue at the judgment will not be Sin, but on our relationship with Christ. Does He know you? \n You might say, well, sure, God 'knows' everyone. He's Omniscient, right? The \"knowing\" we are speaking of is reminiscent of the Garden of Eden, where Adam \"knew\" his wife, they conceived and bore Abel. It speaks of an intimacy, a one-on-one relationship. \n I know I have a relationship with my wife. We talk every day, several times a day. I have a desire to be with her, when she's not around. We have a joint checking account. You see, I can point to many proofs that I have an on-going relationship with her. On the other hand, If I only saw my wife once a week, (for about an hour), and that's all I cared to see of her...if she crossed my mind once every so often, but didn't really have any effect on my life...how much of a relationship would that be? If all my relationship is just a piece of paper that I had signed 17 or so years ago, and that's it...it's not much of a relationship. \n In the same way, we should have an on-going relationship with Christ. There should be a desire to talk with Him, read about Him, tell others about Him. If those desires aren't there...there probably isn't a relationship either.", "Here's my opinion, FWIW. I think the \"contradictions\" in the Bible prove that the Scriptures were divinely inspired. Let's face it: if the Bible were written by humans, for humans, it would make perfect sense to humans. The fact that the entire Biblical message maintains a logical, consistent thread (while written separately by hundreds of people over thousands of years, disconnected by continents) is astounding enough. (Try to get the 535 or so members of Congress to agree on ANYthing, and you'll see what I mean.) \n But there are just some things of an eternal nature, which simply cannot be understood by our rational, finite minds. (The Lion who is a Lamb; to save your life, you have to lose it, etc.) Who's to say that even those things that APPEAR as contradictions in the Scriptures (origins of evil, etc.)...in an eternal, timeless sense...are not contradictions, just misunderstandings on our part? Something to think about. \n One last thing and I'll shut up. FAITH and PROOF cannot coexist. The Bible says that without faith, it is impossible to please Him. (Hebrews 11:6). I know it would make all of us more comfortable if God would just prove to us that He exists, that He created everything, that Jesus Is Who He says He Is, etc. but that's not how it works. I'm not talking about Blind Faith, however. I believe that God gives us all enough proof in our everyday worlds (see Rom. 1), but only just enough to let faith take over. Then we are expected to live by the amount of Light we are given ...by faith.", "My first thought was: What Biblical events are NOT supported by facts? Throughout the Bible, it names names, places, times, events, almost all of which have been substantiated by modern archaeology. I find this in stark contrast to other so-called religious books (I don't want to start a flame war) which names people, places and events of which there are no credible archaeological finds to back up their reality. \n I have been downvoted for this before, but I gleaned a lot from Evidence that Demands A Verdict. It's a little outdated, but it's a start. There are entire magazines and other perhaps more reputable sources which constantly update modern archaeological finds, and how these finds clarify what we understand from Biblical references.", "It seems to me to be very simple. \"Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" (Rom. 4:2, Gen. 15:6) \n The only currency that God deals in is Faith. If you believe, and trust God, He accepts that faith (in Christ) as righteousness, and the end result is eternal life. \n What happens if you  don't  have faith in the shed blood of Christ for a substitution for your own life? Then the only thing left for God to go on is your own works (and not the work of Christ) in the life you have lived. \n Absent of Faith in God's Son, the only just thing left for God to do is examine a person's works, and discern whether or not that person was \"righteous.\" But the Old Testament Law (Torah) teaches us that no person will be declared Righteous before God, simply by following the commandments (\"All have sinned, and fall short of God's Glory.\" Rom 3:23) \n There is a verse in Revelation that talks about this: Rev. 20:12 says, \"[Rev 20:12 NIV] 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.\" \n What books? What book? The books are perhaps the books of the law of God, which include the 10 commandments. God will examine, very justly, the books of His law, to see if that person followed the law to the letter. If they did, great! Welcome home. But if not, then ....not so great. Every person will have their day in court. \n For those who trust in Christ's substitutionary death, basically get a free pass, as Christ's works, which were (and are) perfect, overlay their own. If you don't trust in Christ's works, you only have your own to deal with, which we have stated fall woefully short in God's eyes. \n The final book that is opened is the book of Life, which is a recording of every one who ever trusted God. (\"Whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved.\" Joel 2:32, Acts 2:21, Romans 10:13). Having never called on Him for salvation, that person's name will not be recorded there, and will not be saved, and at that point are eternally separated from God."], "anchor_demographics": {"age": 35, "gender": "male", "occupation": "teacher", "location": "United States"}, "shift_vector": {"POWER": 0.05, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.07, "HEDONISM": 0.05, "STIMULATION": 0.1, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.2, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.5, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.6, "TRADITION": 0.85, "CONFORMITY": 0.8, "SECURITY": 0.75}, "target_vector": {"POWER": 0.05, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.07, "HEDONISM": 0.05, "STIMULATION": 0.1, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.2, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.5, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.6, "TRADITION": 0.85, "CONFORMITY": 0.8, "SECURITY": 0.75}}
{"user_id": "mswilso", "subreddit": "TrueChristian", "posts": ["According to Hebrews 9:27, \"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment....\" There are a couple of salient points here: 1) It refutes any conception of reincarnation (once to die, not multiple times, and 2) it talks about \"the Judgment.\" There is a sense of finality to the statement, so it seems. \n Based on this, and other studies I have done, I don't think there will be any reconciliation after death. Here's why: Life is made up of lots and lots of little choices. Sometimes we choose for the good, and others for evil. In Romans 6:16, Paul talks about how, when we offer ourselves to someone to obey them as slaves, we become slaves to the one we obey, whether it is a slave to sin (which leads to death, Hell, etc.) or a slave to Righteousness (which leads to life eternal.) \n Only God knows at which point we become an uncompromising slave to one or the other. However, I think there comes a point where, sometime before death, but certainly at death, the die is cast. A person who has spent their entire life in rebellion to God will not \"wake up\" on the other side, and suddenly desire Righteousness if they had no desire for it in this life. \n A side note on this: In the parable with Lazarus and the rich man, the rich man begs Abraham to send someone from beyond the dead to speak to his brothers about Hell (Luke 16:19-31). \n > 27 \u201cHe answered, \u2018Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.\u2019 29 \u201cAbraham replied, \u2018They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.\u2019 30 \u201c\u2018No, father Abraham,\u2019 he said, \u2018but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.\u2019 31 \u201cHe said to him, \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d \n The point here, is that if they are not convinced about the reality of Heaven and Hell on this side of death, they certainly won't be convinced after death. (With a side note of prediction of His own resurrection. If people are unconvinced of the realities of Hell after Jesus' death and resurrection, what further conviction do they need?) \n The problem is not that they don't have enough information. The problem (as stated in The Matrix ;)) is CHOICE.", "Keep in mind the Rapture is a \"sign-less\" event. By that I mean that the only detail Jesus gave us regarding His return for the Church is: \"Watch!\" \n However, the Jews were given specific signs to watch for the \"Time of Jacob's Trouble\". Many of these were given in Daniel, Isaiah and Jeremiah, and I also reference Matthew 24 and Luke 21. \n But to condense all this information into one place, here are what I believe are 10 signs that we are in the last days: \n \n The existence of the nation of Israel  \u2013 In Isaiah 66:8, God through His prophets declared that in the end of times, the nation of Israel would be re-born in a day. On May 14, 1948, by decree of the United Nations Security Council, the Nation of Israel was formed. It\u2019s amazing to me, that only after a short time, most of the world is lined up against Israel. Why? Because there are supernatural powers that understand that the existence of the nation of Israel is a harbinger of doom for Evil. \n \n Wars and Rumors of Wars  \u2013 (Mark 13:7-8) Jesus clearly stated that His return would be immediately preceded by a time of unprecedented national and international warfare. According to \u201cProject Ploughshares,\u201d there are RIGHT NOW over 50 major armed conflicts in the world today. If you include WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War(s), Iraq, Afghanistan, and other regional hot spots, this is a clear sign we are in the last days. (Add to that, [Syria]( and [Iran]( [Turkish border incursions]( \n \n Birth Pangs  \u2013 Jesus said that the end of days would be marked by increasing sorrows, much like the birth pangs of a woman in labor (Matthew 24:8). There would be  chaotic weather . As \u201cdelivery\u201d draws near, birth pangs increase in both  intensity  and  frequency . WATCH AS OUR NATION (AND OTHER NATIONS) CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY INCREASED CIVIL PROBLEMS, MOB VIOLENCE AND UNCERTAINTY! \n \n Multitudes traveling to and fro  \u2013 (Daniel 12:4) says specifically that the end of days will be marked by great advancements in travel. Not more than 100 years ago, horses and foot traffic were the only modes of transportation. Now, we have cars, airplanes, subway systems, and more. We have been to the moon, and are sending probes out of the solar system. Prior to the industrial revolution, few individuals traveled beyond their local community. Today, millions are \u201crunning to and fro\u201d just as Daniel predicted, more than 2500 years ago. \n \n Knowledge would increase  \u2013 Again, Daniel 12:4 states that in the end times, knowledge would see an explosive growth. Anyone heard of the Internet? It is estimated that the cumulative knowledge of mankind is doubling every five years, and the growth is not static, but increasing at a fantastic rate! \n \n The increase of Deadly Diseases  \u2013 [what the Bible calls \u201cpestilences\u201d] (Matthew 24:7) Emerging diseases such as AIDS, Ebola, Hanta virus, Dengue fever, West Nile virus, SARS, Bird Flu, and Swine flu, just to name a few, underscore this fact. Ironically, just a few decades ago, some scientists were forecasting that advances in medicine would someday eradicate deadly diseases. (And since the original writing in 2009, we have the  Ebola breakout \n \n Earthquakes in different places  - (Matthew 24:7; Isaiah 24: 19-20; Revelation 6:12-14 and Revelation 16:18-20) Seismic activity appears to be on the rise. Along with the increase in earthquakes, it seems that earthquakes are happening in places that before had been geologically stable in the past. ( /regional/neic/ for more info.) (Oklahoma has just issued it's first ever \"[Earthquake Warning]( \n \n Russia would rise as a world military power.  \u2013 (Ezekiel 38-39) Russia (here listed with the tribal name of Gog and \u201cMeshek\u201d (Moscow)) is predicted to be a world military force that would one day lead an attack (with its southern satellite nations) on Israel. Remember, that at the time this was prophesied, Russia was nothing more than a marauding band of unorganized horsemen and mercenaries. Who could have foreseen the development from that \u2013 to a world-influencing powerhouse that is Russia today? ONLY GOD knows the future! And now [Russia is back in the news]( flexing his muscles in Crimea and Ukraine. \n \n Youth would become increasingly rebellious  \u2013 (2 Timothy 3:2-3; Mark 13:12). No comment necessary. Just have a glance at the history of popular culture, which is leading our country, and the youth of the world down the path to destruction. From the earliest times of the Rock and Roll era, youth have been initiated into \"rebellion as an art form\", and the Bible says the end result of all rebellion is death. (Some experts say we are only one year away from [Global riots]( \n \n **The  resurgence of the Sanhedren  there is a call for a rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Why is this important? Because Jesus, Paul and John speaking prophetically, all speak of a Temple in Jerusalem, with Old Testament sacrifices in place, when the end comes. \n \n \n Why is the Rapture imminent? Jesus said that the generation that sees these things begin to happen, like labor pains, will be the generation that sees His return. What is a generation? I have a long discussion about generations, but typically in this day and age it is around 70 years, give or take a few. \n Some have argued that these things have been going on for a long time. Perhaps. But to see ALL THESE THINGS happen in such a short time frame (less than 60 years) should give us pause to think. \n Jesus said, \"No man knows the day or the hour...\" So I'm not setting dates. That would be foolish. But if Jesus said, \"This generation...\" and a lot of these events began around the 1950s (specifically, Israel becoming a nation in 1948), then there isn't much time left.", "Romans 8:1, \n > \"Therefore, there is now NO CONDEMNATION for those who are in Christ Jesus...\" \n Guilt is a bad, but a very powerful motivator. \n What this Word from God tells me is that, because Christ is now my Lord and Master, guilt has no place in my life any more. I am no longer motivated by guilt, but by my Lord. \n Sure I sin from time to time (1 John 1:8-9), but sin is no longer my master (Romans 6). I no longer have to do something simply because I feel \"guilty\" for not doing it. \n Because I am now led by the Spirit of Christ, I follow what He says, not popular opinion or what the Jones say I \"should be\" doing. \n That being said, if I am doing something genuinely WRONG, then I SHOULD feel condemnation (from God). But God is always very specific about what my sin is, as opposed to Satan's taunts, which always appear very general and nebulous (angst, anxiety). I don't know about anyone else, but with me, God tends to focus on actions, whereas Satan just wants you to \"feel\" wrong. \n There are other verses, too, which speak about \"not having a spirit of fear,\" or other negative emotions...but this one is my favorite.", "Light\" is knowledge. This analogy is throughout Scripture. For example: \n > Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. (Luke 11:34, NIV) \n The Light that Jesus gives us is the knowledge of where real life comes from. Life is not found in pass times, or in idle pursuits. Life is not found in our work, or in our relationships, or in any other distraction in life. The source of all life...is in God Himself. \n \"I have come that they may have Life, and have it to the full!\" (John 10:10, NIV). \n Where does this \"abundant life\" come from? How does one get it? Jesus not only demonstrated the answer to these questions....He IS the Life. (John 14:6). \n I know some of this sounds \"cryptic\", but I don't mean to sound that way. It's just that we are talking about something very highly spiritual, which does not translate well into human language. But I hope this helps some, and if you pray to God, He will be willing to \"enlighten\" you.", "Well, it's based in several things: \n \n It's based in a hope, a dream that I will not experience Death. Maybe it's the fear of death..but I don't fear death so much. I fear pain, but that's not the same thing. \n \n It's based on what Jesus said, that, \"This generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.\" (Matt. 24:24, Luke 21:32) Which generation? It could not have been the generation He was speaking to...they are all gone to be with The Father. (Although He did say to keep watch...no one knows the day or the hour...) But none of those previous generations saw the kinds of things we are seeing today, things he spoke about directly: \n >  \u201cLook at the fig tree and all the trees. 30 When they sprout leaves, you can see for      yourselves and know that summer is near. 31 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.\n> \n  > 32 \u201cTruly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. \n The fig tree is a symbol for the Nation of Israel. Israel as a nation ceased to exist in 70 AD when Roman Emperor Titus sacked the city and destroyed it, scattering the entire nation. \n Then in 1948, by decree of the UN Security Council, the nation of Israel was reborn in a very short time from when the Nazis tried to exterminate them. \n Jesus said that the generation that sees these things happening, will not pass away until all the things he spoke about occurred. \n \n It's based in a study of current events, and knowledge that people, rather than improving and getting better, they are getting worse all the time, and falling headlong down the slippery slope. Many Scriptures bring this out: \n >2 Tim 3:1-3: But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God\u2014 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. \n > 2 Peter 3:3-7: 3 Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4 They will say, \u201cWhere is this \u2018coming\u2019 he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.\u201d 5 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God\u2019s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. \n \n \n I have pointed this out in other posts...but I feel this is one of the strongest indicators that we are in the last days: That there exist angry, intelligent, and purpose-driven (pardon the pun) Anti-Christians who want nothing more than the eradication of anything having to do with God. And they are gaining steam. And God will give them what they want...for a short time. What they are basically asking for is nothing short of Hell on Earth, with no God (No Love, No Justice, No Mercy, No Patience, No Kindness, No Peace, Goodness). Look around us. It's coming. \n But the good news is this: Jesus wins in the end. Not that I win, but if I align myself with Him, I'm on the winning team.

How the hell could we  not  just punch massively above our weight and dominate the largest empire ever seen and still hold a colossal chunk of politics and the economy in the era of nuclear power? \n The reality is we got lucky. Someone has to have our position, and it turned out to be us. We lived on an island full of forest and bog iron and coal. It allowed us to be a significant power, and cut off the ability of others to get in our way and invade (what with there being a sea in the way). So while everyone else was fighting each other, and while europe was busy fighting the empires in the east, we developed the best bows in the world and built the best boats. Which meant despite being small we had the advantage for most of the time. It allowed us to do things like launch a shitload of crusades, and rape and pillage our way to wealth in a manner learned from the Vikings. \nThe crusades meant we innovated, and created banks and similar international structures that we loaned or sold to other countries for even more power. By the time europe had finally finished off the turks and ottomans, we were too strong to be ignored, and despite being a tiny island had become a technological forefront. \nFrom there on it was just that we kept on advancing, and never really let up on the lead we had. Science and technology was more or less entirely centered in the UK, as well as banking, trade and navigation. And we eventually used that completely unbalanced power/size ratio to expand into the empire on which the sun never set. \n and then our rulers got fat, stupid and lazy. Stopped bothering to innovate or push the boundaries, made a few mistakes, tried to be (ironically) what america is currently trying to be through the world wars and paid the price for our own hubris. Now we're  absolutely  riding on the coattails of centuries of success and reputation. A large part of the power the UK holds today, particularly in organisations, has nothing to do with it's inherent strength or economy or power, and everything to do with the fact it   had  that power, and is clinging to the positions it earned with all the stubborness of a british badger.", "Yeah, I'm not clued into this chicken thing (not american) so I'm going to keep this brief and focus on the one point I'd rather change your outlook on. \n The First Ammendment.\nIt's called an 'ammendment' for a reason. It's a change to the constitution. Constitutions are  the  most solid, unchanging thing in a democratic society, but they  aren't  absolute. They shouldn't last forever and they should change over time. Imagine if the English constitution had been unchanged since pre-christian times, and it was constitutional to sacrifice a third of your crops to the earth for a good year? how would the modern human even define 'crops' for a non-farmer? \n My point is, the american constitution, even it's ammendments, are ancient, several centuries old. The right to bear arms, ignoring the odd wording. Is from a time when 'arms' meant a musket that could be fired aproximately once every three minutes, maybe once a minute if you had training, and could be stopped by a thick piece of wood. 'Arms' today can include a weapon that can spray three  hundred  bullets a minute, through kevlar shielding. \n My point is this. The world changes. Society and morals change. The Freedom of Speech was written centuries ago, at a time when it was designed to be in direct contrast to the english system of lords and differing rules, to create a system where everyone had equal rights, the right to speak without fear or being shot because your lord disagreed. It wasn't written to consider a time when you couldn't be shot full stop, where people would have  so much  freedom to be able to stand up and try to oppress others.\nSurely, the people who wrote freedom of speech, who wanted every person to be able to live a free, safe life of their own choosing without being shot for thinking differently to someone higher up the chain, would have completely disagreed with rich people who tried to use their wealth, standing and power to argue against freedom of life and oppress choices they disagree with?. Surely such writers would even say \"No, freedom of speech doesn't extend to using it to oppress others. It is a tool for protection, not a weapon of subjugation\".", "Britain doesn't have a tipping-culture like America, our food-peoples are paid minimum wage or better so don't rely on tips to eat. \n Brits don't tip  deliveries , and on the rare occassions we do it really doesn't exceed 5%. \n With restaurants and eat-in meals. There's no set rule, it's generally common to put down 'some' tip, but this can vary from shrapnel in your pockets up to a large percentage. \n When I go out with uni-mates, we'll usually just dump  the change in our pockets onto the tray atop the bill, it's very little to us, because we'd never spend it, but it adds up to probably about 5-10% total (\u00a35 worth on a \u00a350 meal). \n With family, I think we've always put down between 10 and 20%, depending on the standard of food and staff...and size of the bill. We aren't going to give more than 30 for a 200 pound bill, but a 70 bill will usually just have 10 or 15 tip. \n To add to this.  Most  places that let you pay by card have an \"Add Gratuity\" button that automatically puts on a tip by whichever percentage the place uses, which I've never seen go above 25%. \n Some  places will also automatically put on (usually 12%) gratuity. This is generally seen as an extremely underhanded and scummy tactic. Because while they  will  take it off if you ask, you have to  ask , and as I'm sure you're aware, vocalising complaints is something of a taboo in british culture (unless it's extremely warranted, and then you just can't stop us.). \n I'm fairly sure Pizza Hut isn't one of the ones to automatically at gratuity, and because it's a recipt I'd be willing to bet that particular waitress simply ran the recipt and hit 'add gratuity' every time, which is something the customer alone should do when they pay on card.", "I've recently done a dissertation on the topic of sex offenders, so I'm kinda reasonably qualified to answer (In that...I've done an assload of research around this very question xD) \n It's  not  fair, in any shape. But it's done because we live in a paranoid society where the 'think of the children' mentality reigns supreme. Nearly everything is done 'for the children' (Ironically except the few things that would actually make the world a better place to inherit). The result is a collossal, irrational  hatred  towards anything that might threaten children. It's one of the reasons there is a social stigma against single dads taking their young children to a park, and why women are preferred universally in the west as carers to children, because there are more male sex offenders than female (partially through fault of the law, Women are legislatively incapable of committing rape. Sexual assult, yep, but the offence of rape specifically requires a biologically organic penis) and the consequence is a public opinion that all men are more likely to be dangerous with children than women. \n The Sex offender's register is a  horrific  punishment, and it's so bad  because  of the reason for it's existence. Face value? it's a great punishment, track the movements of potentially dangerous felons, give them some order in their lives (they have to check in with police monthly), it takes away the freedom to succumb to their desires in part, and promotes a healthy, organised lifestyle. The problem is it exists  because  we have such a dim view of SO's, and  because  we have such a dim view of SO's the register is a terrible punishment. \n Murder and Rape get you the same prison sentence, but Rape comes with the added penalty of life on the register. First off, how is rape, horrifically wounding someone's life,  worse  than murder, ending someone's life? Secondly, you ask  anyone  for a snap judgement of a sex offender, what does your mind turn to? \n Child Molester. \n That's the simple truth, being put on the register in this world, is being branded a Child Molester and all the abuse, shunning, attacks and aggression from society that brings (hell, it's common knowledge even other  criminals  like to beat up SO's) \n It's not even remotely fair, in the UK, being  cautioned  (as in, warned not to commit crime, but not actually prosecuted because there's not enough evidence of any crime) of a sex offence, /any/ sex offence, is enough to be put on the sex offender's register for 6 months. And if you break the rules, it's an automatic 5 years in prison, and then 5 more on the register. So, it's entirely possible for you to urinate in public when drunk (public indecency), be put on the register, miss a check in, and wind up in prison for five years and not be removed from 'Pedophile' status until over ten years after your intial 'crime'. \n I think  this . Normally, nothing much really right? just a slap on the wrists? Hell, the girl's family said they didn't really want to prosecute when they found out what his punishment would be. \n He's now on the sex offender's register for the next  ten years  (half what it would be because -18), for the crime of  creating and distributing child pornography . Just, let that sit in your mind for a moment. He's not going to prison, the girl and her family don't want him to suffer like this and have stopped prosecuting, it's the state mandate now, he will be a 27 year old man still on the register for distributing Child Pornography. And who the hell is going to believe him when he says it was his ex when he was 17. Would you believe it from a 27 year old  today ? \n And this is considering it's australia, which like the UK is more  lenient  than America. We don't have Megan's, Sarah's and Jessica's laws (Again, proof in the pudding, we're so worked up over the concept of pedophillia we can't even legislate properly around the topic, and create knee-jerk laws  named  after victims. What the hell kind of justice system  names  laws after victims?!?) and sex offenders are only made known to actual authorities. \n By comparison, in a city in California...I think [* edit - thanks to /u/C0NFUS4TR0N , I was in fact meaning [Florida]( ], it was awhile ago I did the research now, a combination of Megan and Jessica's laws means that hundreds of sex offenders are reduced to living in vans or gutters on the outskirts of the city. One of the laws prevent them living within a square mile of schools/parks/etc etc, and the other gives every single person the right to check who's on the list. The result is that in the tiny amount of available housing they can live in, the majority of the landlords will check any prospective purchaser and refuse to sell to sex offenders (Bear in mind what I said earlier, that some sex offenders aren't even  convicted* sex offenders), leaving people with nowhere to live. \n Again, perhaps that's fair, given how we treat pedophiles? only it's not just pedophiles, urinating in public, necrophilia, bestiality, public sex, public nudity, as well as all the regular adult rape/sexual harrassment etc comes under sex offences, and has the same punishment. \n Now, we could get into the deeper sociological implications of this, and I'd be inclined to say pedophiles have become societies modern scapegoats. We no longer use gays or blacks as punchbags, and for whatever reason mob-society needs  something  to hit, and because enough pedophiles are the abusive, rapist, molesting kind we treat all pedophiles and all sex offenders the same. Cruelly. But I've tried that before, and case-in-point reddit just isn't capable of accepting that kind of concept, so instead I'll say; 35 years ago the man who hung around outside my mum's school and flashed at anyone who went by, children included, was the harmless weird old man that made the area part of what it is. Today, that same 60 year old man would be tackled to the ground and beaten within an inch of his life by an angry mob, then thrown in prison for a decade or two before anyone thought to check if he was possibly senile or had other issues.

Instead, it destroyed the concept of banks. Used to be you could walk into any bank anywhere in the world and it would be full of people chatting, working, selling stuff, after the 'Grand Exchange' update, banks were simply buildings you could access your stuff in, and totally dead. Again, they fucked around with it repeatedly, because it wasn't working to stop bots, and people complained. \n \n Kept adding more powerful gear, till the original 'end-game content' was utterly useless \n \n Adding 'easier' content, minigames and training methods that outstripped anything else, and made it effortless to reach high levels. \n \n Added in a 'skill' that was essentially just a minigame, and refused to admit it was just a minigame even though it was horrifically unbalanced \n \n The big one that made me quit, added in 'micro-transactions' in the form of outright gambling (buy roulette wheel spins, maybe you win a lvl1 dagger, and maybe you win the rarest piece of armour ingame...it's usually the dagger) \n \n \n In essence, most people say that when the new CEO was hired things went downhill because they focus on copying what makes MMOs successful in a standard format, with the exception of a few updates, everything was angled towards raking in the same playerbase that plays Pay2Win MMOs, introducing microtransactions and making levelling and obtaining high-end equipment easy as hell, which simply devalued the achievement and value of  having  these things. Case in point, for the first four years I played, 'Zezima' was a household name that /everyone/ knew, the first and  only  guy to have hit 99 in every skill. By the time things started going downhill there were maybe 5 with maxed skills and exp-bars (it maxed out at 200M xp or something, and lv99 was 13M). I just went and checked now, over 5,500 players have every skill at 99.", "While I agree with your sentiment, personally and relevantly, the 'hunger bar' addition definatly spoiled MC for me. \n The game retained all of the previous features, 'hunger' was nothing but additional content, but it dramatically altered my ability to play. I can either play in 'safe mode' and avoid hunger, but also completely miss out on probably the biggest part of caving and exploration, the mounting fear as you lose yourself in caves. Or I can play in regular mode with monsters, but it means I can't just spawn and start building hunting, I have to time manage, I have to race to build a farm instead of a house and linger around to make enough bread to sustain me for awhile, then plan how long I can spend exploring building (no more getting caught up or lost) before coming back to farm more food. It also made you essentially immortal, since a little running would avoid damage long enough to regenerate all your health. Instead of planning and combat and avoiding difficult fights, survival is based now entirely around whther or not you possess 'food' (when I last played Bread was basically the only option, since there weren't masses of respawning animals, and everything else took a lot of effort for minimal gain.) \n So, while improving the realism of survival, and making it much more about 'living' in a whatever, to my and many other points of view, it very much detracted from the survival experience to us.", "Others already have, but I'm going to comment on the bits I haven't seen people make mention of, or emphasise enough. \n Apparently Endgame stuff sucks, I haven't got there yet, but there are plenty of people playing all the time on it. And apparently 'Nexus' (the server-wide event) causes terrible lag, but I still see dozens of people all over the play loitering around for it to start. So despite all the complaints, endgame stuff is clearly still appealing. \n If you start playing, I'd recommend joining the US game, by EnMasse. There's basically two because of some weird censoring issue or something? Issue is resolved, but there are still two companies. USA uses [EnMasse]( the EU uses...Terra [EU]( They are  the same game  so it doesn't matter which you download from, but they use different  servers . You cannot access Celestial Hills from the EU client, for example. Its your choice, but having tried both, I've found the USA servers more full, friendly and welcoming. I'm a British player, and experience no lag I don't experience with any online gaming. \n The game is utterly  BEAUTIFUL . If I can remember, I'll take a screenshot of my experience for you all. But, I run it on a basic laptop, nothing special, integrated graphics card, it gets hot if I play Solitaire too furiously. I can run Tera on setting 1 (graphics go from 0-5) with no laggyness, and it looks amazing, it adds enough lighting and shadows and depth to look spectacular compared to other games I'm forced to play at minimum. \n Coupled with the above, Combat is a delight to play. Though I've become kinda addicted to healing, if you start playing, do NOT play a ranged class (Archer/Priest/Mystic). This game...the best way to describe it is actually as a Hack'n'Slash I think. The Melee combat is fluid, interesting, FUN to play. I think  TotalBiscuit likened it to God Of War  each  race  has different animations for the skills. And given most races are balanced (Popori/Elin are preferred for PVP thanks to smaller hitboxes, but that's about it) it does actually come down to preferences, Baraka are usually favoured as [priests]( for example, because the solid, stoic animations lend themselves to a healer rather well in most peoples opinions. Also with classes, they're actually balanced. One or two are OP in a few instances, but in general, a healer or mystic /needs/ a team to do the damage for them, the DPS classes /need/ tanks to draw away the damage, and while Tanks are more than capable of soloing the game, it will take them  hours  without support. This game does its best to force 'MMO' onto you, and it works very well, finding a party is reasonably easy, and playing in a party is much more fun than soloing. \n Skills are very much all usable, the game doesn't just throw shit at you because 'reward for lvl!'. As a slayer I had half a dozen skills by Lv35, and was using all but two or three in 90% of my fighting, and they didn't need to be 'cycled', I was free to change and shift and use them in different combinations as I felt or needed, the game rarely forced a \"Press 1 then 3 then roll then 5 to kill, and repeat\" mentality. As a priest I'm lv28, have an entire skill bar (24 slots) almost full up with skills that are all used. The only reason I /don't/ use some skills is because there's not enough space, so I ignore the 'blessing' type skills in favour of a defendable healer. \n There is no pay-to-win aspect, the game is easy enough and  fun  enough (grinding really doesn't feel like grinding, and I haven't had to grind at all and I'm lv40, the max is 60.) to dissuade bots or gold farming, and all the microtransactions bar a few are for appearance purposes only, the sexy mounts move no faster than the standard guildpony. Speaking of which, Mounts are nothing 'special' you get a permanent mount for free at lv11, after leaving the 'beginner island'. The 'p2w' system is a bit like Tribes Ascend ('nother awesome game if you like FPS games), you /can/ drop lots of money and get tonnes of 'benefits' but actually? you really don't get any great advantage over other players, and a totally f2p person is still more than capable of kicking your ass. \n Yes, the females are over-sexualised, but /everything/ is over-stereotyped, and you are more than capable of picking a non-hyper sexualised female character. Play the entirely male (or rather, genderless according to the lore) race? They're  massive, square blocks of Stoic, contemplative stone giant . The fact Tera makes a point of sexualising both genders, or playing to many stereotypes, precludes the fact it doesn't take itself terribly seriously, 'hints' at loading screens suggest you\n Not be a dick Allow party members to take toilet breaks\n*work together to get 'phat lewt' (actual terminology)\nAnd kindly notifies you every hour with a message you've been playing for so many hours and to 'play responsibly' (I've seen it so often it's taken on a passive-aggressive \"GTFO and get some air Boomsc!\" tone in my head xD) \n There are negatives, the crafting system sucks ass, it's slow, boring, and costly to get up for not much benefit, enchanting is a pain, and tutorials and help is NOT very good, though stuff isn't too tricky to work out. And apparently endgame content sucks, but they really aren't major, and just push again to what the game is actually designed around, combat and co-operation. \n There is also a very heavy Roleplay community in the game, it's the secondary thing the game bigs up, with servers specifically set up, some for PVP, and some for PVE and RP, it's not a forced thing, I've not bothered with any of it, but it's another plus if you feel like giving depth and story to your own character or something. \n Last thing, PLEASE don't start the 'Elins are pedophilia material' gripe if you join? A) no one but the people complaining see it as that, B) if multiple countries and continents don't see it as that, it's clearly not a problem, C) No one...and I mean  no one  gives a fuck. You might be wondering why I'm bringing this up? Because we've  all  heard the complaints and whining a dozen times over, you have no new thoughts or reasons for feeling that way, and we all know that the people who come in with that attitude never even make it above lv20 before getting bored and disappearing, so I'm putting this here as a kind of warning. If you feel people who like/play as Elins are pedophiles, or in some way feel the need to announce this for whatever reason in game. Don't waste your time downloading the game, you will not be liked, accepted, wanted, or have fun, and I guarantee you, if you're one of the people who fill the chat box with annoying spam about Elins, 1)no one will care or even listen, it's not trolling when everyone just mutes you, and 2)you'll get bored by lv20, because no one will play with you. Many players find people who play Humans odd, because it's seen as a boring class to go with (and when you could be a nine foot Amani giant, who am I to argue! xD) but no one feels the need to call out Human players as \"Fucking imaginationless retards\" or something.", "It doesn't help that instead of trying to  help  privileged people understand the position and why they need to think carefully, so many people just scream \"CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE!\" without any rhyme or reason. \n Comment that clearly needs to be re-evaluated because of personal advantages? \"CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE!!!\"\nA comment that might sound vaguely like it's thoughtless \"CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE!\"\nThe poster is  possibly  a cis-white man \"CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE!\"\nThe comment makes a perfectly valid point, but is coming from someone not of the relevant minority \"CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE! YOU CAN'T COMMENT!\" \n As someone who is fully aware of the concept of privilege, and spend my life trying to keep aware of mine and speak and think beyond it, the actions of the vocal minorities mean in any given discussion I automatically shut down and ignore a debater if they start talking about privilege. Like 'misogyny' it's a word people have just started throwing around left right and centre because it gives them justification for completely ignoring any point someone might have.", "In all, brutal honesty. Who really cares anymore? \n I played RS for what feels like close to a decade, and gave up almost a year ago when it just got too -crap-...well, money grubbing. Focused entirely on what would make people pay consistently, rather than improving the game itself. The whole microtransaction crap was  after  I left, so I can happily say I'm not all 'butthurt' about that, it was everything -else- that was a problem and breaking. \n Took a quick skim through the numbers, and it made me laugh, from what I remember, barely 70,000 accounts were ever logged in at one time before I left, and  more  than half were estimated to be bots. There's little chance of them reaching 'Level 2' let alone 3 or 4, this is just  another  bid to get more short term members rather than keeping people who have and would have paid for years. \n So many games seem to go this way. If it's primarily online and f2p/optional payment, it almost inevitably winds up focusing purely on turning a quick profit. And, as racist as it might sound, it's a  painfully  japanese thing to do. EO in particular is a perfect example, they have half a dozen games, each are vaguely similar or copy another game or genre that was popular when concieved. Not a single game is 'complete' and only the most recent recieves any kind of attention, to the point Eudemons, a game with a -very- large population and great potential, is  still  riddled with basic bugs and language flaws four years on. EO churn out a base game as fast as possible to match a trend, reap the profits, and move on. \n Jagex started doing the same in Runescape, 'updates' became geared more and more towards easily grinding or a way that would hook more new players (I remember the  most  insulting updates were the ones providing updates to 'FunOrb' or whatever its called, a totally different game-site Jagex manages...I'm on RS.com to play fucking runescape, not to hear about your attempt to rip off Worms, Jagex). Then they started doing just like EO, they've released a game  stunningly  like Minecraft, but with guns, lately, and were pouring efforts into a Runescape-Esque Transformers game just before the appeal from the movies dropped off. \n Saddest thing imo is HiRez doing this, Tribes:Ascend is an  incredible  game, and it's being slowly butchered to squeeze out as much money as possible while they work on 'Smite' (A LoL rip-off in third person view) \n EDIT"], "anchor_demographics": {"age": 22, "gender": "male", "occupation": "university student", "location": "United Kingdom"}, "shift_vector": {"POWER": 0.1, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.2, "HEDONISM": 0.15, "STIMULATION": 0.25, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.85, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.7, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.65, "TRADITION": 0.78, "CONFORMITY": 0.2, "SECURITY": 0.55}, "target_vector": {"POWER": 0.1, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.2, "HEDONISM": 0.15, "STIMULATION": 0.25, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.85, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.7, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.65, "TRADITION": 0.78, "CONFORMITY": 0.2, "SECURITY": 0.55}}

Jeremy himself was the one to write up a report of the incident and 'turn himself in'. \n Exactly  why  is somewhat debatable. It occurred in summary over food. But the hows and whys vary from totally reasonable (namely that the producer has a chip on his shoulder for Jeremy, and deliberately 'forgot' to sort out food. After twelve hours shooting without a break to find there's no food when there should and it's the cock you have issues with, punching seems reasonable) to totally Christian Bale level inappropriate (generic producer [who are typically overworked] provided cold meat instead of hot food.) \n The bigger problem is that Jeremy is particularly controversial. He's very 'old boy' and an awful lot of his jokes and attitudes and reports about his personality come across with it. Even his very good friend James May happily refers to him as a knob. Top Gear has repeatedly been pulled up and made to apologize over insulting prostitutes, truckers, Mexicans, Argentinians etc etc and Jeremy is frequently at the heart of it. \n However , opposing claims that people on the show have it out for him  does  have some merit. The  last  'big thing' surrounding Top Gear/Clarkson was over his singing a racist version of 'eenie meenie' (again, old boy mentality). The thing is the footage was never actually aired, after someone scripted it and recorded it, producers went 'Nooope' and cut it but apparently didn't delete the footage, and later someone leaked the specific recording of him singing 'catch a nigger by the toe' to the news. \n A massive chunk of the news  surrounding  him is just the tentacle fallout from his suspension, claims that he has the BBC by the balls and plans to sue him, rumours that Alan Partridge is set to take his place, and predictions that Top Gear simply won't run without him, and if the BBC let him go ITV (big english channel) will simply buy him, because he owns the rights to Top Gear.

Mayweather won. \n People are mad for two reasons. The first camp are mad because they turned up to watch Pacquiao, a terrifyingly strong boxer (I coincidentally watched a compilation of his best knockouts a month or so ago and he actually is kind of exciting to watch) beat the tar out of Mayweather. Instead very little 'boxing' happened and Mayweather controlled the entire game through heavily defensive moves, including 'bear hugging' which stops the opponent being able to hit you properly. \n The second camp are mad at the  first  camp because what Mayweather did is  completely  legal within the game. He didn't cheat or break rules, he just played to win, and they think it's unfair people are shitting on the game when to an avid fan's eye Mayweather demonstrated impressive skill in his defensive style of play. \n It doesn't help that Mayweather has historically said he only plays for money, not for the sport, and by winning took home 200M instead of something like 150M if he lost. People feel that instead of doing his job of putting on an exciting show and walking away a loser with a tonne of respect and money, he 'sold out' the spirit of the game for a little extra profit.", "The old Battlefront had a bunch of unique features making it very very popular.

Everyone who no longer votes for Liberal Democrats by and large  still don't  want to vote for the other two (Of course it's far more complex, and the other two are losing voters like leaves for various stuff, but in simplicity;) and the result is a significant portion of them have begun voting for UKIP. It has now reached the point where UKIP is popular enough to not only be tentatively described as 'a fourth party', but to compete and potentially exceed Liberal Democrats, by current ratings like [this]( \n Now, that in and of itself is why UKIP are being talked about  so much . What doesn't help matters is that UKIP is a particularly controversial party, and the big three are  heaping  as much bad press on it as they can in an effort to subdue it before it becomes set as a significant power. \n UKIP stands for United Kingdom Independence Party, and their head ideology is to reclaim independence for the UK from international bodies. Secession from the EU is an obvious first. \n What the party  actually  believes/advocates/is guilty of is a very contentious topic, and I don't think it's fair to get into that here, if you're interested you should read up on the party manifesto and decide for yourself. Any opinions and discussions about the party are extremely biased for obvious reasons. \n The Big Three are heavily invested in ensuring UKIP is  not  seen as a potential party, which means any negative side to the party is amplified, and any benefit is played down. For example it's rare to hear public chatter about any of the party's tenants  outside  EU and Immigration. It's also extremely likely to hear 'immigration policy' spoken of in an extremely negative light regardless of any actual problems that need addressing. Same goes for stories about UKIP Members being racist or sexist, while the same for the big three are generally brushed under the rug."], "anchor_demographics": {"age": 22, "gender": "male", "occupation": "university student", "location": "United Kingdom"}, "shift_vector": {"POWER": 0.78, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.52, "HEDONISM": 0.18, "STIMULATION": 0.61, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.55, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.64, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.28, "TRADITION": 0.22, "CONFORMITY": 0.19, "SECURITY": 0.49}, "target_vector": {"POWER": 0.78, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.52, "HEDONISM": 0.18, "STIMULATION": 0.61, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.55, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.64, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.28, "TRADITION": 0.22, "CONFORMITY": 0.19, "SECURITY": 0.49}}

That means any developer can write an app to sync with their hardware and as we've seen already they have access to things like voice commands and the Kinect. So if NEST suddenly wanted to make your thermostat suggestion a reality they could do it easily. Just the same as any dev could. We are already seeing integration with phones and computers.

They have a vision that will possibly allow not only their product but the entire product market to grow and therefor be stronger. The console is no longer has to be just a toy for a child (in the eyes of the public) it's something for every person in the house. Something that everyone can benefit from and therefor agree on. This is why I choose the Xbox it simply showed more vision where as the competition was \"off the shelf\" and \"made for games\" which is all good for gamers there's nothing wrong with that but i'm an adult whose needs and wants go past gaming. I saw from the get go that this could benefit everyone in the long run.", "Some tests I ran a while back: \n [I tested the following (gallery is duplicate of first four below):]( \n Main Menu Active: [73W Rough Average]( \n Forza Prague Lotus Cockpit: [116W Rough Average]( \n Ryse: [127W Rough Average]( \n Sleep State: [17-18W Rough Average.]( \n TV through Xbox One (BBC America 5 minutes): [76-77W Rough Average]( \n It should be noted the \"sleep state\" would jump 2-3 watts (topping at 21W total) every few minutes for 1-2 seconds. \n Have you tried unplugging the console and giving it a full power cycle?

In this way they have many comparable features through OpenGL/CL but they do not have the actual DX11.1/2 API's as this is Microsoft owned and licensed. \n This should mean porting games between the consoles and pc is relatively smooth but it does not mean the consoles are both using the same API and therefor experience the same performance/features. \n Honestly the way it's been portrayed is very misleading imho.", "US Top Gear \n Not jealous. \n I went to SEMA in Vegas a couple years back and Top Gear was there taking people for rides in some high end cars as advertising for the US Top Gear.

{"user_id": "lookmeat", "subreddit": "programming", "posts": ["The idea behind patterns is that there's certain ways of thinking and acting that we humans fall into. These things happen even in completely different problems. So we can find management patters in a team of 5, or a company of 10,000 and this is without even discussing what these groups want to do. \n The patterns started with programming, but have slowly been creeping to other areas. In theory you could see them anywhere people have to think about how to do something. \n Patterns where originally pushed as positive, things you want to do. The idea is that you could realize that a pattern applied to your situation and then you could use the collective wisdom from everyone who's used that pattern even if no one has ever dealt with your problem. But then some of these patterns where found to be bad ideas in general, they sound good, or seem attractive, but in reality leave you worse off than if you hadn't followed them at all. This began getting called anti-patterns. \n An interesting thing is the following anti-pattern: putting the pattern before the horse. This is, patterns are not a magical solution, they appear in certain cases (and should appear naturally). The idea is that you should recognize patterns and anti-patterns within what you are doing and act accordingly (improving implementation and avoiding common mistakes, or trying to avoid the anti-pattern). Some people force the patterns, assuming that the more you add the better. I would say patterns are like salt, if you add what's needed towards the end you get something really good, if you add as much as you can at the beginning you'll finish with something inedible. \n So in short (", "I am a programmer, I know of the interruptions. I've worked in both environments, and personally prefer closed offices. Still sometimes close offices give me too much distraction and I finish going somewhere I know no one will find me. \n But my argument isn't what's better for you or me. It's not about what is good for the programmer. It's about what is good for the business that hires the programmers. And the business doesn't need their programers to be at their full 100%, they'd rather save on office space. It's as simple as that. \n The problem is that people start arguing about this logistical decisions, and talk about the solution to optimize one variable when the problem that needs solving arises only from the interaction of multiple variables. It's like trying to say that you found a P solution to the knapsack problem by only worrying about getting the most value but ignoring the weight considerations. \n > Programming is largely a sequential task \n Yes, but the thing is that companies will not have you only \"program one thing\". They'll give you a list of bugs that need to be solved, a series of objectives needed, give you 20% time for you to work on unrelated projects. These things work because coding will block longer on waiting on other things (send a ticket to have a strange bug on someone else's module that prevents your code from working at all, then waiting for that bug to be solved). \n Programming then is not really sequential, it's single threaded, cooperative multi-tasking. Think of the even-loop for single-threaded javascript (nodejs) and you'll get it. If you think that you don't loose a lot of time blocked on having to learn new stuff, on running tests, on passing code review, on having questions answered, on having bugs beyond you fixed, etc. then I'll be the one wondering what kind of professional experience you have programming and where I can get this job. \n > This of course, is incorrect. You're a lunatic if you believe this. Or if you believe that it's mostly parallel with some small amount of integration. \n You are a lunatic if you think that it isn't the case. The whole success of git (and DSCV) is that unlike the original CSV which assumed that only one person was doing (and submitting) code changes at a time, DSCV would allow multiple people to work. Indeed if we think of the different projects as threads, and the code as the data, you'd only need SVN, and git would not improve your workflow at all (because no task is done in parallel to another). \n Programming any project of certain size, the kind you'd have in a company, needs to be optimized by parallelization. Using various constructs to support the concurrency and synchronization needed (DCVS, code reviews, meetings, tracking tickets, etc.) the whole thing is kept reasonable. \n And yes, this means that as always, some effort is lost in synchronization (ie. you end up being less productive individually) but as long as the final product appears faster and cheaper (the whole team is more productive, even if it's by using a open floor plan that makes you less productive) then the company will succeed over others. \n Which leads me to my final argument: why is it that it's so rare to see successful companies that use closed-office systems? Why are companies that used open-floor systems so common? If they latter is destroying their programmer's productivity to the point they are mostly useless, then the former, even if rare, should be more succesful. We should see hundreds of articles written by MBAs with no idea about programming talking about this. The meme and practice should thrive and surpass the inferior ones, yet we don't see this case.", "I think that the problem is that both sides are criticizing misuse due to taking things to the extreme blindly. \n So TDD is all about building with tests, and having those tests verify your content. TDD allows you to begin by defining the interface/API to your code,  then  building example code that uses it and can be verified (proving all  behaviors  of your API). Then once you've implemented the behaviors of your function (and it's usage) through tests you begin coding. \n TDD detractors claim that TDD takes more time. When you consider that requirements change all the time, you'd have to change the test, which is exactly what you don't want to do! They also claim that TDD leads to superfluous tests. \n TDD defenders claim that people don't  get  TDD because it's meant to protect and verify. A test suite guarantees that requirements are kept, changing the test first when requirements change  guarantees  that the new code now follows the new requirement (by changing the test). Since TDD pushes you to unitize behaviors as much as possible (instead of repeating them all over the place) it also promotes designs that make it easy to change requirements: if you only have to test it once, you only have to change it once. \n And so goes everyone discussing about the extremes vs. the standard. \n So lets see things with a bit of actual Common Sense\u2122: \n \n Try to keep costly code (code that changes a lot and is hard to maintain) small and isolated. Because it leads to lower maintenance cost. \n Test code in a cost-benefit analysis. Code that you know is rarely ever going to change it's  behavior , it's requirements and guarantees, is good for this. Code with simple, small behaviors (that does one thing and does it well) is also prime candidates to have tests (even if they change it's easy to define it). \n Because of the last two points if you have trouble testing code it probably means that it is costly to maintain, and should have the parts that change a lot (business requirements, etc.) moved away into units that only have one or two behaviors, leaving the rest of the code alone. \n Only test the behaviors you will stand by. Don't test things that aren't requirements or things you won't guarantee. \n Untested behaviors should be considered undefined, if you depend on it you should build a test to guarantee it won't change. \n Unit tests are nice, but not always needed. \n Tests should be easy to do and run quickly when possible. Isolation is all about testing one behavior, and having less behaviors on each thing you test (less tests per thing). \n Coverage is a good guide, but not required. Functions may handle conditions you don't want to keep solid with test. Maybe it's an error case that causes the program to crash, but later could be replaced with recovery. \n \n So you don't jump to do the tests and the design that. It's more like: you do standard design, starting with a \"rough sketch\" that may change as needed (iterative design), focusing first on implementing the minimal viable program. Choose the modules with the least dependencies (since they will shape other modules more than they are shaped themselves) and define the modules more in detail. Define the signature, pre and post requirements, and the actual functionality of things. Build a series of tests that verify the previous case, the first test is actually using the code, which challenges the design (you may realize something is stupid or annoying, that you are calling functions that should be members, or that member functions should be stand-alone). With the tests done you've done the full design of the module. Tests don't have to be unit tests, but they have to verify the behaviors of the module. You may find it easier to decouple the module so that there are less behaviors to test (since they become pre-requirements) and it makes it easier to test. You don't have to mock everything. \n Finish implementing the module. Analyze risk zones: which are areas were an unexpected error would be unforgivable? I'm talking of Heartbleed level bugs here. Build tests for those things, the more important the better they should be. \n Go to the next module, repeat the process above. \n Do you have to test  everything ?  NO DON'T DO THAT . Many behaviors may take more than one function, so a single test could cover them all. Test the things outside of your module, but you shouldn't need internal testing on the module (unless you like expensive unmantainable monster of modules). \n Does it ever make sense to not make tests? Yes! Do a cost analysis. If the feature is tiny, rarely used and modified, and very simple, you may not want to test it and instead handle it when the very very rare bug gets reported. If it is a proof-of-concept code or a quick and dirty prototype. But what if that proof-of-concept becomes the real deal? Then you actually define what you want, build the tests for the behaviors and test your proof-of-concept, it'll allow you to clean code easier. Redesigns were unavoidable either way, but you can now redesign and then refactor until the code looks nice.", "You're in /r/programming, but I suspect you've never written a program of non-trivial complexity. \n This is /r/programming so I expect that you've never designed and managed a system with people of non-trivial size.  Again we assume that humans will fail or work in completely unpredictable ways (look at the process for investigating and preventing a human caused accident at a plant). We don't call them bugs because we expect humans to work in completely unpredictable ways. \n Imagine the complex program you have, except that the kernel is having sex with another process and decided to give it your resources. Also the X-Windows system came today and decided to fall asleep. Oh and your code has a big issue and drinks alcohol hidden from everyone else. Oh and the code that handled the network connections got pregnant, but that's ok: we have vi handling all that. Trust me, human systems are so corruptible and fallible that only now that we can have predictable and controlled automatons doing a lot of the trivial tasks can we begin to imagine that a system with little errors did not exist. \n Trust me, the system for votes in  incredibly shitty . It's shitty to a level that it's not funny. Of course they never tell you this, I mean do you really want to hear \"the basis of our society is built on a sham, it requires ideals that simply are not possible, such as counting correctly all the votes in a city\", or \"well it fails a lot, but it's good enough I guess\"? There's no reason why machines would do the job of handling votes any worse than humans. \n Have bank heists gone up due to the increase of ATMs? Of course not, they've gone down because stealing from a cashier is easy, stealing from an ATM is incredibly hard (the ATM doesn't really care if you'll break it's knees, it can't just give you the money). Are ATMs really that much less trustworthy than cashiers? Yeah there are ways to trick them into give you 10x the amount of money you asked, just like humans can [be insiders]( \n So computers are more predictable than humans. They don't get sick and send their cousin instead at the last minute, they don't become irrational because of a tumor, they only have one function and can dedicate their whole existence to that, unlike a human that has all of these variables (the rest of their life) affecting their decisions. \n That's that beauty of computers, if I get a weird state I can just reboot to a known state. I can't just \"reboot\" a human to a \"clean slate\" without sounding like a general from some distopic novel. \n Can machines be hacked? Can humans be bribed? We do systems to verify if machines and humans are working as expected (or if outside tampering has happened) and go on with life. The thing is that it's easy to track  every single little thing a machine does ever  and use that in the decision, with humans it becomes ridiculous when we have to decide if the chimichanga s/he ate matters at all.", "Ok, now make me a program, that given statically known ranges for haystack, lenght, needle and map_func, it returns to me all the possible values for index_of. \n I will show you how, mechanically I will find a bunch of bugs in your second function. Your challenge is to make a set of steps that are as simple (for a machine to run, you can't have judgement calls) to decide if your first function has errors or not. \n \n We enter the function assuming nothing of your values. They can be any valid values within the ranges given. \n We see the assigments and defin ret = -1, i and val are undefined. \n We begin the for, i is now 0. \n We see that for the loop to be valid i < length. Since length can be any valid int, this is possible. Also ret != -1, but ret is already -1. The function will never be run. \n ERROR: FOR LOOP NEVER RUN. \n We jump the whole loop and see that the function returns ret, which can only be -1. \n ERROR: index_of always returns -1 independent of arguments. (why even have a return value?) \n \n Even with this fixed your function will always return -1 if needle == 0. Let me show you how my system would realize this: \n \n We allow haystack to be any array, length to be any value, map_func to be any function. But needle has the value of 0. \n We begin and ret has a value of -1 \n We enter the for loop, i cannot be greater than length within this scope. We cannot say if it can go under 0 just yet. \n Now we go into an if, this if states that haystack[i] cannot be 0 (remember NULL is just 0). \n Now we add a new variable val to the stack, it has the value range from map_func given the range of any element of haystack. \n We now compare haystack[i] (which is of the set [MIN_INT, -1]U[1, MAX_INT]) with needle which we know is 0,we compare a value that is not 0 with a value that is. Since there is no else, we jump the if entirely. \n We pop the scope out of the outer if. \n We pop the scope of the for loop. \n Now we return ret, which can only be one value: -1 \n \n Wait this might not be that easy to deduce. We should have just choked at you comparing an int with a NULL either way. But there is more! \n Lets go again, and see if my system can realize that map_func is never used in the function. \n \n Again we have our setup, this time variables can be any valid value, we assume nothing. \n ret = -1, i and val are undefined \n the for begins, i < length at the start of the loop. It is 0 first. \n We start with the if \n val = i < length && haystack[i] != NULL ? map_func(haystack[i]) : undefined \n we enter the next if, add a new condition haystack[i] == needle \n ret = i < length && haystack[i] != NULL && haystack[i] == needle ? i | -1 \n We exit both ifs with no more actions. \n Before exiting the for, we notice that we only add values to 0. Which means it can be any number greater than 0 (the machine could probably be even smarter, but lets keep it simple). So now i >=0 and i < length. Notice that i is always initialized. so we can describe its values as the range [0, length] \n Now we return ret which has the value: ret =  i < length && haystack[i] != NULL && haystack[i] == needle ? [0, length] | -1 \n But wait, we notice that in the return val is never used, and map_func never affects the results! Nor the value of anything pointed by an argument! \n WARNING: map_func seems to be invariant (though it might be the case that the side effects are useful, returned values generally should not be ignored). \n \n PUM I just found another bug in your system.

Not only that you are loosing half your money in stopping people from attacking you! \n You know who doesn't care about this costs? Big companies. Do you really think $100,000 for a 1000 notices monthly is really that expensive? They spend way more on putting a song on the radio for a week! 110 million a year sounds like a lot to you and me, but to this companies it's just another expense, a couple layoffs and they're back on track. And that is the problem, it's a lot of money for me and you, not for companies, and the DMCA and copyright should protect us, not fuck us even more. \n Lets make it more interesting, say that a company wants to fuck you up. Say that you brought this video that talks against them. The first thing they do is start creating copies of your famous videos to take away ad revenue, then they issue DMCA takedowns on your original ones. Sure say you sue and get back at them, but by that point they won: they censored you and fucked you up. You had to use up your money in DMCA takedowns against them to stop the bleeding, and then you had to waste even more money in court.

They promise all the same benefits and claim to be a good schooling system, but can't back up their stance. \n Bootcamps are great, but they are not replacement for school, I see it more like a complement to traditional school. It works great for those that need something more hands on like bootcamps, but it isn't as great for those that need to understand the theory to get into something (they'd benefit from normal school). If bootcamps sold themselves more like seminars and less like private schools I think this problem wouldn't happen. \n And yes, I expect a teacher to have a BA at least.

No, I expect something more pragmatic, something to open my eyes to how things are done and leave me at a starting point.

Just because you are representing a abused minority doesn't immediately make you \"good\", you can still be an asshole and still be wrong. \n The CEO is allowed to have an opinion without loosing his job because of it (or having his company threatened because of it). \n You're allowed to have an opinion of said CEO, and also this opinion should not affect your ability to get work (even at that CEO's company). \n What is ethically wrong, is to threaten a person because of their beliefs (even if they are wrong) on something completely unrelated. This is, threatening to fire someone because of their beliefs (when they in no way have interfered with his or her job) is  wrong . Threatening to boycott someone with his or her beliefs, when this have no effect on what their business does is also  wrong . \n To put this in another way. What would be your opinion if Eich had to leave Mozilla because he donated money to stop prop-8. He left because he was threatened by the conservative groups in California with boycott of his company, and it was the only way to save it. \n I believe that the  ends don't justify the means  and that  believing or thinking something does not equal acting on it . Yes Eich believes against gay marriage, but he decided to act on it  democratically  he never threatened anyone, he never used his position in Mozilla against people of the LGBT community, he decided to work with the system, and trust that the solution  best to society  would be chosen, the decision was made, and it was that prop-8 is unconstitutional. Eich didn't make Firefox show a message saying how our society was going to collapse because of this on start up. He sucked it up and accepted that society had made its decision. \n See the difference there? Eich, though as much as I might look down and disagree with his believes, acted in a much better fashion than the people boycotting him. He didn't attack individuals, he never threatened people, he never made a fuss or use his position as a company to push a political agenda (looking at you OKC). \n So what did we (as I identify more, sadly, with the anti-prop-8 group here) win? Well we got someone that supported prop-8 to no just loose his job, but also have to abandon the work of his life. I'm sure that having your livelihood and life-projects threatened is a great way to change someone's mind. Given that people [fear being forced to loose the job if they didn't support the LGBTQ community fully]( we've just given ammo to the pro-prop-8 group. The next time they want to push anti-sexual-equality laws they'll be able to point to this case and show how the LGBT community are a bunch of bullies that if given the ability will take your job away and threaten you. \n Hell not even the ends are good! This isn't the end justifying the means, this is hate justifying the means. People wanted their revenge, and in the process put the whole LGBT community (yes all of it) on the same level as the bigots and fear-mongers that work against them and have damaged what arguments they could have used. Representing such things implies a lot of responsibility.", "I find interesting that you argue (correctly) that there is no one person behind this. But then you seem to imply there is a unified, concerted desire to corrupt this. \n Sadly it's the opposite, governments always want to do the greater good, but in their disorganization sow corruption, slowness and the complete opposite of which they which to achieve. It's a basic human nature, good dead paving the way to hell and all that. Sadly there's [mathematical theorems]( that could imply that you can't ever have total, perfect order, you need chaos and destruction, and no one has ever even considered a government that wasn't the complete opposite of it. \n I agree with you the governments will turn against people. It's not that power corrupts, it's not even that absolute power corrupts. But power attracts the people who love power, and corruption is nothing but a trick to gain even more power. Power attracts the corrupt. \n The US has especially had a serious case of this. As a foreigner living in the US I've noticed the ego-centrism here being huge. It feeds into so much, the paranoia and fear feed of the belief that anything bad that happens to you HAD to be by someone specifically against YOU (what else would anyone else care about more?). If the world turns around you, of course anything bad is directed intentionally against you. \n NOTE: I'm not saying YOU or any individual are like this, but when you aggregate everyone you get this kind of attitude. (Like no one really has 2.2 kids, that's impossible) \n The problem is that because of that you see the problem as someone else. You assume that the problem is that someone is evil and is trying to hurt you intentionally. It might be democrats, it might be republicans, it might be the government, it might be Christians, it might be black people, it might be the intellectuals, it might be Mexicans, it might be Muslims, it might be the Chinese, it might be the ignorant, maybe it's a mix or all of them. See you assume that these persons are the cause and they wish to be. \n If we only sit back and see it openly, no one wants things to go as they are happening right now. But good intentions rarely work the way they're supposed too (as you might have guessed I'm extremely wary of good intentions, and generally avoid people with a lot of good intentions). See everyone thinks they are doing the best solution. Or justifies that they never really had a choice (it was that or starve) no one really thinks themselves evil. \n So you are like the government: implying that social welfare is about controlling people (which history shows the opposite: the less welfare the more oppression). You also claim that the US should give less benefits, when it is the country with the least benefits given to people (no social medical care, wages way below living rates, abusive work schedules that take over your life), seeing history it shouldn't surprise us that the US is also a country that is being pushed into a more domineering country as it goes. \n But you would probably argue for more freedom and less regulation of companies. Which is also where we are going, and what promotes the government to grow so much. You, without knowing it, are promoting the growth of the government. \n And you, with your good intentions, extend your power all the time, and with good intentions you do the whole set-up for the same problems all the time. \n And so do I, I abuse power and constantly feed of it. And just like it's hard to live with barely enough food to make it by, it is with barely enough power. \n I am part of the problem, aren't I? I am guilty seeking safer places, and would pay extra for a neighborhood were the police gave more patrols (isn't that me begging for more government with my money?). I promote checks and controls for the government, that make it like a snake that feeds on itself and always grows bigger. I constantly scream against injustices in the world, is that not pushing for a bigger international influence? And as the UN shows, influence with no military power is little influence at all. So I am promoting the military-corporate complex. \n See we are looking for people to stop, we think there is few people behind it and that stopping them will solve the problem. Sometimes we find leaders and kill them and are surprised when 5 more pop-up. It almost seems as it's human nature, as if civilization were mere weak scaffolding that supports the delusion of greatness when we are really just animals in the mud. And that's the thing: we are, and we can't change human nature that easily. \n But we can make the scaffolding better. We can change the way we treat ourselves and our government.

Trust me they had a lot of that back in the ancient times and it wasn't fair, or just, or any good. \n Justice is all about social order, and what is best for everyone. I'm sorry that society can't help you and only you, but that's kinda how things go. \n See it's not about punishment, too many people see it like that. You did a crime? Well first of all damages have to be paid for, it only makes sense that the guilty party does their best for it. If it's a crime that is impossible to pay back fully (say a murder, or damaging historical events, or simply the guilty party doesn't have enough money to pay) a deterrent punishment is given, try to make it as much community service. Finally if the party has shown they can be dangerous to social balance (violent or especially hurtful crimes), then you remove them from society temporarily (send to prison) until you can guarantee that the risk has been reduced. It becomes a lot cheaper to invest in reeducation and helping someone get on their feet while in prison than keeping them longer. So prison is not a cage where you keep \"bad guys\" but a rehab center where you help people grab a hold of their life and make the best of it. For especially dangerous men, that would be considered a risk to society due to mental illness (or a demonstration that they won't reasonably integrate with society), they are sent to psychiatric care at facilities meant to handle people like them (high security prisons) in the hopes that some way to improve their situation would be found in the future. \n See by taking a revengeful and punishing attitude you only make it worse. Send a guy to prison, now everyone has to pay for him. Say this specific example: who wins? Is society winning by now having to pay for a person that used to be productive and help society before but now can? Is the victim winning in anyway, is anything getting fixed for those that got robbed, how is the years this man is loosing making their situation better? Is our attacker improving by now not being able to have a job and probably he and his family being forced into the situation that drove him to crime the first time? It seems everyone is loosing something and no one is really winning anything at all. \n Moreover I think its extremely dangerous that you can be punished in a society for something you did 13 years ago, even if you where found guilty back then. Always assume that the corrupt will take over anything. Imagine that one day you wake up by a SWAT team and are taken to prison because you did some crime but where allowed to go with a \"stern warning\". Then someone decided you didn't deserve that and chose to punish you by removing the fact that you weren't punished and \"surprise\" now you owe years in jail.", "Well it's hard, we don't really understand how horcruxes work, it's not explained also how they make you immortal. \n An easy way to imagine is that when you are killed, your soul departs to limbo, and cannot proceed (as it is maimed). It would make sense that you can't return to your body (since no one seems to do that in the HP world). Instead you can be pulled back to the bodies remaining, powerful artifacts. It only makes sense that this artifacts could bind you much in the way your body binds your soul to one place or another. How this led to Voldermort to be in Albania isn't explained, but it might have just been he was close to there and went possessing bodies, living of them by stealing their life-energy, he just couldn't do the necessary jump to a body that could move him away enough from the forest. What is clear is why he couldn't jump to a locket too far away: nothing to posses, and couldn't jump into a place with many powerful wizards around: he'd be too weak to do anything. Why not a Muggle? Duh, he may be a dark wizard but he obviously has his standards and would never \"lower\" himself to be in a muggle. So he had to wait until a wizard weak enough came close to him, and he could posses him. This was Quirrel. The problem is that he would have died very quickly, so he needed to find a way to make Quirrel's  body  immortal. Notice the importance of the body, since Voldermort didn't need Quirrel's soul to remain, only his body. This failed when Quirrel was destroyed, and we are lead to believe that Voldermort's soul was returned to the forest. \n Again, he did not go into the diary in the chamber of secrets because it was too risky to be so close to Dumbledore and other powerful wizards. Not only could he be discovered, the horcrux could be discovered and the hunt for them could begin. Wormtail, as Scabbers, though realized that Voldermort was still around and found him. Maybe Voldermort told him where to go, or he was able to search for him using magic. The whole point is that he went back to Albania, it's not explained why Voldermort got sent back there instead of something closer to Hogwarts (where the artifacts he needed were). Everything else is all about recovering his body, being able to rebuild it. It's not explained why he needs Harry Potter's blood, but what is clear is that if he doesn't have a body he gets sent back to Albania.", "Yes I know I could have gotten a refund. That wasn't the point. I think it's called sunk cost... \n I'm sorry to be the annoying guy, but it's only a sunk cost if you can't recover it. Also it's generally assumed to be a common fallacy that people think that sunk costs should be considered when making a decision (to continue or stop), this is not true. The only thing that should matter is the costs remaining, sunk costs can only reduce the remaining cost. \n An example: say that I've payed $500/$600 (non-refundable) for a thing, but I've found that the thing wasn't as good as another $300 thing, I could stop paying for the $600 dollar one, return it and then buy the other one, but that would cost me $300, OTOH keeping the $600 dollar one only costs me the remaining $100. Basically the $500 I've put into it could have been $1000 or just $50, it doesn't matter because that money is lost and will not be recovered no matter what I choose, what only matters is how much money I can make. Now say that I could return the $600 piece and get back half of what I've payed ($250), at that point the $300 piece would cost me $300-$250 back, or just $50 USD, a much more convenient thing. Again it doesn't matter how much money I've invested, but only how much money I get back, the only reason the former matters is because the latter coincidentally depends on the former, it should not guide my decision. \n Since the movie was painful, even if you hadn't gotten your money back, you only made that money be spent on something that caused you pain. Basically it's better to give money to some homeless person and not even get a thank you back, than to give the money and get kicked in the balls.

You as a parent would know this. Some people don't believe themselves capable of giving their child what they deserve. Given how many bad parents (the kind that are always away, and travelling, and mostly ignore the kid) are out there, we should respect people who choose not to be that kind of parent, even if that implies not being a parent at all. But that doesn't mean they hate children or can't stand being around them, they only need to know that kids need a good environment for them (outside in the backyard running freely, not in the living room filled with expensive pottery). \n OTOH I have met a few parents that seem to hate every child except their own, and dislike when someone else's kid comes over and does things slightly different.", "I can say the third is certainly wrong (only someone with an american accent would pronounce it like that).

Fully MOS qualified soldiers can attempt to become rangers. Being fully qualified means learning how to move and shoot in BCT, then more job-specific skills in AIT. For Infantry, the \"more job specific skills\" are more moving and shooting, so these two things are combined into something called OSUT. \"Boot Camp\" is what other services call BCT/OSUT. \n To summarize: You can go to Fort Benning and just do your regular Infantry MOS training without trying to become a ranger (this is what 11X with no option is). You cannot immediately try to become a ranger without passing some form of MOS training. \n >Can I start my first 4 years with 11x and then through the middle of my term, request to try for Rangers? \n If you're squared away you can, with the support of your leadership, opt to try and become a ranger once you're already in. However, this is  not  \"Option 40\". Option 40 is specifically getting the chance to go in your contract. If you don't get Option 40, there's no guarantee that you'll get a shot. \n >Can someone fresh out of high school attempt to be a ranger or will they have to have prior term of service \n This is precisely what Option 40 is for most people.

This is the guy everyone thinks of when they say \"He could go make three times as much as a civilian, military is so underpaid!\" \n This is, however, not the case for the vast majority of military jobs,  especially  at the level of education/experience the military requires for new hires. \n Straight out of High School, there's very few civilian sector jobs that will give you 30 days vacation, healthcare, food, housing, and a $20,000~ salary.

Most officers are not prior-enlisted. Some non-prior-enlisted officers are awesome, some prior-enlisted officers are assholes. \n You don't \"earn\" an officer promotion by being enlisted. You simply do some years as enlisted, and then enter into the officer track the exact same way a civilian would.

Even at the height of the wars there were plenty of people who enlisted and never got deployed. There were even more people who deployed and never saw a single engagement. \"Going to war\", especially in the 2000s, is mostly boring bullshit.

You will then be absolutely miserable for the rest of your contract when you realize that you're barely in the Army at all, you spend your two days a month reading powerpoints, and you probably won't ever deploy. \n Stop hiding behind the \"others influenced me\", and the \"I don't want my friends to think I'm crazy\". You're a big boy now, make your own decisions. It sounds like you really don't want to be a naval reservist doing an office job, but don't idolize the other parts of the service because you think they're more high speed.

This leads to a lot of \"empty\" support where people might clap or put a sticker on their car, but not really care beyond that point. You'll still find people who will conflate people who will carry out the nation's will with the people who determine it, but it is (luckily) seen as a bit of a juvenile stance to hold. \n It'll be interesting to see how the coming generations, who are so distanced from the lessons of Vietnam, will treat modern service members.

As a junior unmarried service member, you live in the barracks and have your meals provided at a dining hall. If you're married or more senior, you receive food and housing allowances on top of base pay (depending on location, these allowances can be more than your paycheck). Health care is taken care of, which is a massive expense as a civilian. You get access to a bunch of facilities like gyms, pools, etc. You're issued your basic set of clothing and receive a yearly allowance for replacements. You usually have some education benefits available. \n A good rule of thumb is that if a civilian paycheck isn't at least 30 % more than a military paycheck, the civilian isn't actually better compensated. A civilian may spend $1500 of their $2000 paycheck on necessities like rent, health insurance, and food. As a service member all of your necessities are taken care of so your base pay is mostly discretionary. You can save it, invest it, spend it on toys, etc. It isn't unheard of for someone to get done with a 4-year contract and have fifty grand in the bank because they simply don't have to buy shit. On the other hand, a lot of people get into trouble because a brand-new guy to the military  can  afford a $800/month car payment, it is just a really retarded idea. \n Despite all this, if you learn some extremely marketable skills in the military, they're going to have trouble competing with the levels of cash that the private sector offers (or even the government civilian pay scale). This is why they provide incentive pay for certain skill sets (airborne status, language proficiency, etc). If you're in one of those job sets that is extremely hard to retain they tend to get around the fact that they can't simply pay you more by offering large re-enlistment incentives. At the high end, that can mean $60,000+ bonuses for sticking it out a few more years.

The alternative is saying \"This far and no farther, we don't want to hear better than we do, see better than we do, because we value privacy more than our ability to sense and communicate freely\". We don't value privacy that much though, not enough to halt our progress as humans. Privacy, at its core, is an extension of shame. People don't want their mothers to view their browser history because they've been taught that what they're viewing is bad. People don't want others to know their secrets because they're ashamed. We're going to be more willing to dissolve shame than we are willing to stop the advance of technology. \"Yeah, everyone knows what kind of porn everyone watches and nobody gives a fuck\" is a far more likely outcome in the year 2200 than us deciding to cripple our technology so people can continue to be ashamed. \n So what's the problem?  During this transition period, that near-omniscience for some creates haves and have-nots. It concentrates power in the hands of those who can hear and see, while leaving the still-deaf and still-blind without the ability to compete.  This makes people  incredibly  angry.", "There's a subreddit specifically for basic income discussion where I'm sure you can find this argument played out a dozen times daily. There's also been quite a few CMVs very similar to yours where people have attempted to explain it. \n From what I understand the massive expenditure would be covered mainly by dissolving most current welfare programs/benefits and the fact that those above a certain income would be paying back into the system far more in taxes than the basic income would give them.", "Oh, and you're not doing the same thing by equalling entire demographics with one hypothetical guy? \n I was, and that was my point. I was demonstrating a very obvious strawman argument. \n > IMO it boils down to \"people who are supposedly very knowledgeable about music dislike this chord progression and I don't understand why\". \n Fair enough, you've boiled it down like I asked in my initial post. The likely answer here is that the people criticizing this particular technique don't evaluate music on the basis of popularity. They're evaluating music based on its originality and contribution to the medium. Since we're talking art, the value of originality vs. popularity is almost entirely subjective.", "Could we be more efficient in our goals? There are literally tens of thousands of people who's full time job is to think about and investigate that. Intelligent people with decades of relevant experience. \n Name a measure to increase efficiency and it has likely had intensive study or been found to be unviable. No project is perfect, but I think you underestimate the brain power and planning you can buy with billions in R&D. \n Your particular idea strikes me as incredibly inefficient. Carriers have a unique ability to project power and gain a significant advantage in efficiency by having centralized resources including a nuclear reactor. A large fleet of conventional craft would consume far more resources and be far less energy efficient while being less effective at the same missions. \n Usually a push to \"spend more wisely\" results in merely another tier of oversight that tracks money without meaningfully contributing to efficiency."], "anchor_demographics": {"age": 25, "gender": "male", "occupation": "U.S. Army soldier", "location": "Killeen, Texas, USA"}, "shift_vector": {"POWER": 0.2, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.5, "HEDONISM": 0.1, "STIMULATION": 0.3, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.6, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.8, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.7, "TRADITION": 0.2, "CONFORMITY": 0.2, "SECURITY": 0.4}, "target_vector": {"POWER": 0.2, "ACHIEVEMENT": 0.5, "HEDONISM": 0.1, "STIMULATION": 0.3, "SELF_DIRECTION": 0.6, "UNIVERSALISM": 0.8, "BENEVOLENCE": 0.7, "TRADITION": 0.2, "CONFORMITY": 0.2, "SECURITY": 0.4}}

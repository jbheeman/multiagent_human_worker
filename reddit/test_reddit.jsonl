Mostly it's the validity that the money isn't meant for illegal purposes. Particularly the bitcoin phenomenon and black markets. \n When you click \"Submit\" a lot of things happen instantly. \n \n Money is put into pending \n Amount is declared from paypal \n Bank system notified that transfer is incoming \n Pend against bank system to ensure account is active or available for transfer \n Bank system returns result to paypal \n \n Usually these happen instantly. However there is a system monitoring this on both sides. If either of the systems disagree then the hold is available to be evaluated by the side that terminated the transfer. \n The time mechanism is in place for these instances. It's not a button pushing event to transfer money in those circumstances. There is usually some sort of \"reliable transfer\" information that needs to be acquired. For instance: \n \n I did work for Freelancer website \n I get paid to paypal \n Money is ready for transfer to bank account and I hit \"Transfer\" \n Fee's declared from paypal on behalf of Gov't/Paypal/Bank \n I accept these \n Receipt is produced and money begins to pend \n Bank system verifies that the money is available and account is able to recieve \n \n If anything fails in this timeline then the time period is applicable. Otherwise it gives the bank system and paypal system a long enough time to sort out if the money/account is not only viable, but also not declared stolen from sender etc. \n Otherwise it is instant, even if you don't see it. My bank does a pending allowance. If money is pended and the source is trustworthy, like Direct deposit from a company I work for, or paypal and so on it allows me to use that money. The moment it would fail to happen is when my bank would no longer allow the account to use that allowance from that sender. \n Edit: I messed some words and stuff.", "Junior year of high school I asked a girl to the Homecoming. Things were great. A week before the dance she told me she couldn't go because she heard that I was dangerous. \n I was a hot head and build high school kid. Ruled by emotions, and awkward as all get out. Well I got into the grapevine to see what was being said. I knew some talkers who knew a lot of things. Finally someone told me that her friend had started a rumor because she wanted to double with these two other guys. \n I found out what she said: Supposedly I take girls into the country and force them to have sex. \n Being a virgin, in a bible thumping family... this was infuriating. So I did what any bible thumping teenager does, I started my own rumor. I knew the two guys she wanted(she ended up marrying the one she went with), but they didn't go to that dance together. Basically I feigned having an std and said I got it from that girl. \n When she finally cornered me about it, I told her that if she didn't like me before, that she won't like me if she messes with me again.

I know it is real, but I just want to see it to make sure how I remember it is what actually happened. \n October 11 2004, 0130 CST. \n I was transferring from Lackland AFB from BMT to Keesler AFB in Biloxi MS. The bus wasn't even half full. About 12 of us. 11 males 1 female(who sat in the back of the bus). \n It was a charter, with the TV's. After having a long time of not being able to watch tv, we were treated to Full Metal Jacket. I was sitting 2 seats back from the 3rd TV on the right side of the bus. To relax and lean back to get my sleep, I put my knee cap in between the two seats in front of me(No one was there). I nod off, still hearing the movie in the background. \n I am aware of a feeling that is like a massive push. I braced against the seat in front of me with my hand. It was too much pressure to push back and remove my knee from the seat. I leaned to the aisle and to the front of the bus, I saw the oncoming headlights. \n Finally, impact. It was almost numbing. The sound, the lights, the bumps and swerves. Feeling the bus starting to tilt and sway even more made me brace against the other side seats. And it was over. \n The lights came on in the cabin. After gathering myself and adjusting to the light I was able to begin responding to what was going on. The female, sitting in back, was launched 6 seats forward and had injured her back. A few others had some bruises. Nothing compared to the recipients of the bus and the driver himself. \n We remove the bus driver from his seat and move him back. Secure the situation inside the bus and I acquired a cell phone laying on a seat and began calling 911. Not knowing the exact location I told them near Louisiana/Texas border, we were told there had been a report of a drunk driver going the wrong way. They asked for a description and I provided it. 2002-03 Ford Taurus Se, Silver. Or it was. Half the vehicle was gone. \n I might have been in shock. Going in and out of what I remember. I know that the driver starting crying and screaming, pulling his hair out. The police arriving and telling us to stay on the bus. Another bus arrived and we were escorted off. \n To this day, I've never found an article and the only other person to validate my story has passed away(I called my father while waiting for police). Hopefully one day someone can help me find a link or knows something about what happened to that driver and who the person was that we hit.", "I'm going to call out my father. He passed a while ago but one of the times I absolutely feared the man was at a concert for one of his schools. \n I grew up with a music teacher father. Being the directors son, I would play at the schools he taught at. He was a very high strung man at show time. Focused and perfectionist to the extreme. And I did get a little of that nature. If it isn't perfect it's wrong. So, you best be on good behavior. \n Well, one particular concert(spring I believe) he was talking about things to remember and and going over the show plan. A percussionist in the back was tapping sticks and practicing a part. My father, without warning, walked over, in what I can only describe is an exorcist like calm. Took the kids sticks and snapped them over his leg. \n For anyone who knows what snare sticks are like, know that's not an easy task to do. Fortunately, my dad was always prepared. He pulled out the new pair and handed them off after he was doing reviewing everything required. \n To this day, father or not. If my band teacher did that in my school... or any teacher. I'd be scared shitless. \n Also I saw the remnants of an expo marker in the back wall of a classroom from a teacher getting mad and throwing it. Didn't see it happen however. \n Edit for", "Prior knowledge you should have, my gf at the time loved the top bunk. However she didn't have a bunk bed. So she just bought a bigger frame. She was that way. Anyway on we go: \n It was my first threesome with 2 girls(and I the guy obviously). One was my gf(at the time, now ex) and the other was her curious friend. Apparently they weren't beyond experimenting with each other. Well this was amidst some drinking. Not too much but enough to be effective towards the decision making process. \n So some kissing happens, some more laughs and drinks. Finally it ends up happening and some of the most crazy awesome things are just happening, right then and there. Well this doesn't last. Obviously all good things came to and end and not the way they should have... \n My gf encourages me to go after her friend, we'll call her Liz. I can't describe her personality. And if I truly had time to be around her I'd just not want too. She was a shy one. A red head. Good looking. So we start going at it. Well apparently what I had in mind as \"rough\" was not for her. So she takes control. \n Now she's on bottom, I'm on top, and before you think this is getting saucy, this is the part right before the pain. She goes into climax and she doesn't cease up like any climax I've seen from most women. I understand differences but this one has never been matched. She throws her arms around my neck and lunges me to the being on the bottom, which other than the awkward way your legs are in that position would have been fine until I realized how short the bed was. \n In the end I bruised my back, and a few ribs. My shoulder has never been right since. Worst part was.... she didn't even stop. It took her 3 minutes to finish. She said it was the best ever.

So privileged in fact that, he only needs the one. That being of such a cis-privelege offers him nothing more than being labeled as a person who only likes private parts of their life one way. \n After he consumes this knowledge, I'll infer on him that he's not only part of an endangered demographic, but that it's his cis given right to hate anyone not like him.

Being back and forth from home to my destination leaves some time for me to put a youtuber on and listen. Internet Aristocrat being one of them. \n After getting my fix on the drama, I became moved more so on the fact of what I was seeing than what someone told me. IA talks a lot. And the facts are damning enough. But it's all irrelevant to a user until something makes it feel closer to home. Seeing some shadowbans, DCMA takedowns, and other twitter shenanigans made me come to terms with the fact that image macros aren't just instances of loss of composure. The SJW movement is very real. Thus, #GamerGate must also be rise to that level. \n So I went on a fact finding campaign. Tirelessly going through articles, masking my clicks with archive.today and other proxies. Making sure no one got my support until I was ready. The other day this comes to a fruition. When that, I'm not that crazy... that just happened, occurred. GamingJournosPro became a thing. A sad, childlike, thing. \n I'm a shlub. My opinion could mean a hill of beans to someone. I am articulate and talented in my voice and speech. But I have no self confidence. So, how does this one guy help? Well, I moderate the information flow to other gamers who haven't kept up. And surprisingly, they picked up and found more and more to look at. Mostly coming to the same conclusion I did, which is ,\"Boy it'd be nice to have a Journal about Games\". \n I noticed by looking in to publications(written magazines/articles), that I won't site at the moment as I am not taking from them, but they were beginning to swing. Games critic ratings that didn't add up. Almost like a stats chart of expectation based on previous games. It's almost as if these people viewed a publisher better than another. But never said it. Or that a new developer was more popular with a less capable product. And it was more than just fluff pieces. These are cataloged into time with written word with other pieces that hurt major devs because the game honestly sucked. \n Approaching my 30's, I've become very aware of what I came from. Playing Double Dragon and Super Mario to a 6 monitor set up in Star citizen, or even Raiding in Marvel Heroes with David Brevik(NAME DROPPING LIKE IT'S HOT...srsly it's my only claim to fame).  But honestly, I was tired of being told that some 12 year old with no parents home was making me look like I hated women. Or that the game I just bought is over sexualized and objectifies some other class of less privilege, IT WAS A ZOMBIE GAME!? \n Now, back to the point. GamerGate became something because it needed too. The internet doesn't react how you expect it too. And that's great. Allows some people to break through. But it also allows these weird geysers to get in the way of what's going on.

Either way, here is my response to AChu as a person. \n Nerd Masculinity: This term is just a rope a trope, from a narcissist /wrist. <- That had a literary device... neato bandito. \n I didn't get made fun of, as a kid, for not wanting to play outside and deal with that one bully that wouldn't let me live down I play a video game. The big kid that had a bad life, dad wasn't present, mom's gift was to beat him senseless. The one you feel sorry for later in life, but despise as you grow up. In a way this shapes you into a compassionate understanding human being, a sense of completion and duty in the hardships flown into the ground. All that culminating into riding high in the clouds of personal understanding. What about people who don't understand that hardship is a shaping mechanic of life? Well, honestly those are the people who cry victim, even into adulthood. It's not a rouse that mistakes will be made. But when the only profit off someone's mistake or immaturity is from your Patreon, and not your morale stock... you need to re-evaluate your core belief system. \n If you ever tell yourself that you have to create a whole in your memory, or blind spot in the minds eye, you need to rethink some things. No one is going to tell you what to do with your life, not even these words. However, it's highly suggested that self censoring/blocking can only lead to a split in the fault line. As in, it's your fault. Not the people you want to blame. Most often the people you want to blame will actually care about you the most. Lashing out at your father then watching him turn from, once proud independent man, into a diaper wearing husk is more eye opening than your pathetic victim complex can fathom. And, 'No', you may not use that one. \n Just get off your high horse. No one is fooled. Self awareness isn't a 6th sense. It's a learn-able trait of understanding. Until you understand yourself, you'll keep making up words like \"Nerd Masculinity\" and continue reinventing a wheel of sorrow for your train of 'Poor Chu'.", "First; I apologize for not getting back quickly.

He managed to bond on a personal level anyway. When news broke he didn't just appear sincere, he remained it through a lot of the events. Even while getting railed on. Thing changed and as soon as I noticed, I moved on. KingOfPol was a guy looking for attention. Getting wrapped up in it all was something that really got to him. This is what you get with addictive personalities. YTheAlien and Sargon are just straight informative. Adding a twist to what they do or post, interacting relatively well. \n Now we get to You, MundaneMatt. There has always been a weird feeling there, one that I couldn't place for a long time. Perhaps it's the talk about 'shop', or the behind the scenes chatter rehashed on select steams you've been on(and I have seen). It feels as if there is something to hide from everyone. Even Ralph doesn't have that good of a poker face(really he sucks at it). I'll do more research and see if I can pinpoint what it is that gives this impression.

As a matter of fact it's to the point where it's infuriating more than embarrassing. But here is how it started: \n Go to wal-mart for diapers and formula for the demon son. Get the stuff and go to swipe as normal. \"NSF\". \"NSF... what the hell is that?\", I said the cashier. I'm met with a more holier than thou reply from a wal-mart cashier than should be legally allowed. \"You don't have enough money\". \n I step back and check my cell phone. I swear I had over 200 in my checking at the time. I go to the mobile baking app and it shows 228.32 in the account. Yeah that's right. I check pending payments, nothing is pending the account is clearly in good standing. I go to the bank and question it. They check my card and tell me it's working fine. I go back to wal-mart thinking it was just a hiccup. Same deal. Well I bail on that idea and go to CVS. Same issue. WalGreens and so on. By now the bank is closed. Every single place is declining my card for insufficient funds. The ATM at the bank won't even take it. Someone was awesome enough to help me out and got the goods to me. Yes it was almost like a drug deal in the parking lot, with formula and diapers. \n I get back into the bank on the following monday. I tell them the issues and they run the card on their machines again. It's failing now, giving an error code of NSF. They check the account and claim that it's all in good standing. The customer service guy came over and checked the card. It had apparently been RF checked and that causes the magnetic backing to distort(To prevent theft). You can't see it, you have to take the card apart to see it. This caused the card to distort enough to use a security feature on it. Basically changes the number to a dummy security account. Then if the card is reported they can trace the hits and find the person using it. \n End of the story is, I had to get a new card because someone tried to get my card info. I am still not sure where it happened or when. If you ever work checkout counters, it's not always because they don't have enough money. It could be other reasons", "Animals communicate in complex ways and simple ways. Cat's are more particular on body language and smell.

The capabilities of the animals to learn each other are taught/learned through interactions. \n Now as far as your bottom line answer goes, there are multiple ways they can communicate.

A teacher can go from point A to point B and do the same job. My job(developer) can go from point A to point B and I'd have to completely relearn my environment to do my job in some cases(often the case). \n He went on to mention that grants and funds have a lot to do with the low income, but in actuality it's a job that can pay the most per day worked. He reasoned out that he gets weekends off(standard for almost all salary positions) but also gets holiday breaks and summer off. And taking an assignment during those periods would net him more money via bonuses or programs that are extra paid by parents directly(past the scope of government school funding like summer school). \n In theory, the economy has a lot to do with it and so does the way test scores and funding works(I have limited inside info there). But basically when the economy is high and school programs utilized there is a bonus available for school districts(sometimes given to the teachers union for dispersion). Funding from the government is based on the Income based tax via that school district(voted on by the people and approved by school board/city councils).

As for the quality of care, it varies. Even though you'd think American Hospitals would prefer the idea of billing for more services (And avoiding lawsuits by diagnosing the crap out of people) however I think they'd rather pass them through quickly. \n If a patient keeps returning obviously they get more in depth with their analysis of the patient's problem. I've spent far less time waiting in any hospital in Canada (45 minutes max in outpatients), and more time being \"looked after\". \n American hospitals ALREADY charge the shit out of you for the littlest things (I was once charged 10.00 for a paper towel), so add the appointment fee and you can see they make more through quantity of customers than quality/length of care. As for the wait, I've waited up to 7 hours in outpatients. They're usually overfilled, so their main priority is to get you in and out fast to make way for the next patient. \n As for the quality in the sense of equipment used, procedures, chemicals used, procedures followed,etc they were both equivalent. I think peoples experiences will vary according to the size and location of where you get your care. \nUltimately I prefer the idea of being treated by professionals who are in the business to Help people (VS. Profit) and don't have to worry about their operating expenses or clearing everything through an insurance company or \"throughput\". \nI will say I'm biased though.

They COULD get away with lowering that price even more but that might cut into their increased profit. \nI really don't think the price of goods would come up if all of our manufacturing jobs/plants \"came back to the U.S\" and even if they did it would be offset by the boost to the economy. Plus, I for one agree with you... I'd rather pay a little more for something that LASTS, VS. buying something cheaply made in China that will just break in a year or so. Beeing a mechanic by trade I can appreciate good brands like Craftsman or Snap on. They may be more expensive (I can go to Harbor Freight and buy tools for like 1/10th the price) but the Snap On tool will last my whole life, and the Harbor freight tool will break the second time I use it. \n I really don't think it's a matter of having too many viable employees in the U.S., it's that we mostly refuse to be treated as slaves, and paid sub par wages. The trouble is, Corporate America seems to forget that their biggest \"cash cow\" (The people they sell all their shit to) is going broke, partly DUE to all these jobs going overseas, and pretty soon a lot of people won't be ABLE to purchase all those \"cheap goods\".", "True, personally I'm a pretty \"low cost\" guy, who's actually quite content with a low \"Standard of living\". I'm trained to be a mechanic, and ideally I'd like to just run my own business (With just me and maybe one or 2 friends/employees) doing engine builds/rebuilds. \nSadly I can't just find work at a shop because I not only don't have the back for it (lower back troubles, plus I'm a little too tall to work under the lifts) but I'd need to put in my time for 5-10 years as an oil change goon at minimum wage before I'd even be considered. Even if I WAS given a mechanics job, I'd end up having to spend 10's of thousands of $ on more tools. \n Most of my work experience is in hospitality, I've worked almost every position in a Hotel you can imagine, including management.  Most of my \"management\" positions involved me working my ass off and having all the responsibilities and stress of a manager, yet still making 10-12$ an hour while the next person \"Up the ladder\" was making a half decent 50-60 grand a year salary, usually while knowing and doing less than I did. \n I have had many jobs where I have tried to make them into a long term thing, and worked for a few years, giving it my all; only to be taken advantage of, then fired when they could no longer justify paying me such a miniscule wage. \nNeedless to say it has left me disheartened, which obviously adds bias to my position, but I'd still argue that even despite the truth of your examples, it's still a lot more difficult to find jobs that pay a living wage than it used to be. Plus, it used to be that people could not only \"move up\" without formal training, but they would be paid a living wage right from the start of their job. I think this was a lot more common than people realize nowadays. Imagine starting a new job at McDonalds, or as cashier at a Walmart, and being able to afford Rent and all your bills? Right from the start! That WAS commonplace. \nAmerica has been taught that they only live to work, and that your life should be about work, they have it all backwards: \nIt should be Work to live, not live to work. You shouldn't have to bust your ass, just to \"get by\". Life isn't about performing tasks to enrich someone else, it should be about relishing all the time you can, not working 3 part time jobs just so you can have a roof over your head and food in your belly. \nWe have forgotten that we deserve to be fairly compensated for our efforts and time, no matter WHAT the task, and we are taught that we should just just be thankful someone deems us \"worthy\" of working for them, and shut up when that person takes advantage of us by underpaying us, and not compensating us properly for our time. \n To me it all comes down to time: \nPeople seem to forget that no matter how rich you are, you can't buy time. All the extra time you spend working your ass off, just so you can have a roof over your head and food in your gut is time you can't get back... this is it...this is life and you only have one, no matter who you are or how rich or poor you are. \nYour time is just as valuable as ANYONE else's, so no matter what the task is, if you're going to let someone else use YOUR time towards THEIR goals/efforts, then they better fuckin pay you properly for it.", "SAP Moment: \nI was out working on my car and some Led Zeppelin was on the radio.

Conversely, you still need to pay off $34,000 plus the interest that has and will build up. \n Now let's assume you sell the house for $80,000.

This means that if you were to get a standard 15 year loan, that you'll actually be paying off your house in less time(assuming you can afford to make the payments on a $300,000 house of course), and paying off in less time means that you pay  significantly  less in interest."]}, {"subreddit": "AskReddit", "posts": ["Using your credit is good, but using a majority of your credit is bad.

Who are these people?  What proof do they have for overpopulation?  Are there any other solutions besides defiling the people's right to procreate?

On the other hand, I know people who couldn't even scratch the surface of basic algebra who are actually capable of doing things(productive things, constructive things...I wouldn't put shooting up heroine in these categories, though it is technically \"doing something\").  One guy I know was addicted to crack at age 12(which of course, set him way back in junior high and highschool), but nowadays he does construction and his hobby is in woodworking.  He not only makes functional/acceptable pieces(furniture, decoration, etc), but they have ornate detail and he can make some of the most interesting trinkets(very small, very delicate, but very beautiful).  Society would have you believe someone like him will never amount to anything, but he's more than capable of sitting down, absorbing a book, and putting it into practice. \n One of my pet peeves are the people who judge others on their ability to quote famous writers.  Tolstoy and Shakespeare were great, and pieces of literature don't become classics for no reason, but there are tons of people who have written things worthy of remembering.  I don't have the time/patience to remember these and I wouldn't expect it of anyone else.  Often times(in my personal experience) this sort of 'intelligence' is exhibited by people who talk a lot without saying anything. \n Having what most people call intelligence doesn't mean anything to me if a person doesn't use it.  I definitely don't gauge intelligence on math, science, spirituality, writing ability, or anything else that might come up in a standard academic environment.  It basically comes down to this: A person who is good at something(like painting, for example) also spent a lot of time gaining that expertise.  No one can gain expertise in all areas, so as long as a person is able to learn and synthesize their own answers in at least one area--seen through the ability to complete projects--are intelligent enough for me. \n I know this is at odds with what a lot of people think for intelligence, especially when you start thinking about real world examples.  The Kardashians, for example, are pegged as slutty, rich snobs by most of the people I know.  However, they also publicize many charitable organizations, which is at least something.  There are slutty, rich snobs out there who don't even do that much.  They just slut around being rich and snobbing at other people all day...very unproductive(perhaps reproductive? i suppose that's another topic entirely...). \n I know it's all anecdotal, situational, consequential and hardly empirical, but that's my opinion of intelligence.   Too many people waste their time on grades, IQ, test scores(ACTs, SATs, GREs, etc), which can determine what a person  knows  but none of that determines what a person can  do  with what they know.", "From a programming stand point it's not always easy.  It'd be nice if every platform understood 100% of one particular language(C++ being a prime candidate, since it has been dominant for decades), because then any program written in that language would port to all other computers everywhere.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work like this. \n You get into all sorts of weird issues where a phone or particular mobile platform doesn't have such and such library that is found in the program that you're trying to port, which means you need to write the function(s) that are missing, which is not always a trivial thing to do. \n Also, the physical representation of bits is not always the same.  The two popular styles of representing bits are [little endian and big endian](  A difference in endianness will mean every single arithmetic calculation is flat out wrong, and this can be a huge problem when porting from one platform to another. \n Also, optimization of code is a big reason.

I should also note that I've had to write a lot of papers outside of English courses and I always get full points.

I'm guessing they assumed the person before them was supposed to.  I ended up learning everything I know about grammar and parts of speech through Wikipedia and studying German.  10 hours on Wikipedia + following the sources > the entirety of my pre-college \"English\" classes. \n I once received -10 on a paper(out of 50 points...that's 2 letter grades) because my sentences had two spaces after the period and the new convention(apparently?) is only one space.  I.  Don't.  Give.  A.  Shit.  Whitespaceisonlyimportantsoitisn'thardtodeterminewhatpeoplearewritingandwedon'tallblowourbrainsoutreadingonesentence.  I'm going to continue to put two spaces after the period in everything I type until I die.  The only thing that can stop me is Microsoft Word if it auto-corrects the two spaces to one, but I'll still bang on the spacebar twice for every sentence I write. \n As if I needed another reason to hate English and the people who teach it, my third English professor refused to meet me out of class because my available times were after 5 PM Monday-Thursday, he didn't want to be at the university before 8 AM, and he was out of his office by 3 PM on Fridays.  Instead he told me to go to another professor(he didn't give me a specific one to go to), which took me four tries with the usual response being \"YOR NOT MAH STUDENT!\" \n At least in my cosc classes when a professor writes a -10 they give a reason, and I know what I missed and how I can be sure to not miss it in the next assignment.  The worst comment I ever received(worst as in, least descriptive), was a question mark part way through an inductive proof.  Something like this would be extremely helpful in an English class.  Anything at all would be helpful. \n I've had problems with instructors outside of English, but I've never had these problems in general over such a long span for anything else.  I'm probably a terrible/dry writer but since I've never been critiqued in a meaningful way or taught how to write 'correctly' I guess I'll have to keep on keepin' on and refer everyone who complains to my boss and/or HR.  Luckily I'm not payed to speech human, and the only ones who have to understand me are other programmers and computers(and maybe one other guy in the company in order to track progress).", "I drive often in rural areas with hills and no noticeable features otherwise(it's all grass, no trees, no nothing).  At night, the sky and the ground become the same under normal headlights. With brights, I can see where a hill is coming up(causing the road to turn), or prepare for a drop-off which would otherwise freak me out. \n I should also note that several areas I drive through have half-assed reflector poles.  Rather than being reflective like what you would see on a bicycle, they're simply  metal poles with white paint at the top.  During the winter, these things are not only useless but cause people to drive off the road very often.  It can be difficult to discern the sides of roads even in the best conditions.  Most commonly this occurs around mines(coal, methane, etc...think middle of the USA) where fine dust covers and takes the paint off the roads.  This is so common, if you're from out of town and a cop pulls you over, you can usually use the excuse \"I couldn't see the lanes,\" and it's valid because you can't.  The ruts made by lots of traffic are more tell-tale of lanes than any paint on the roads. \n As far as over-driving your headlights, that has more to do with snow or other poor driving conditions, and turning your brights on will reduce your visibility in these situations.  I'm all for idiots doing this as long as they continue to not over-drive their headlights.", "The only place I can think of that happening is a Pizza Hut Express.  At that point why don't you just go to a Little Caesar's and get a Hot n' Ready for $5?  Pizza Hut's personal pan is more expensive, smaller, and not hot 'n ready.  In this case it's little more than a cheese-ified piece of cardboard. \n You could also pay $10 for a large cheese(from Pizza Hut), wait for 15 minutes while they make it and not have a shitty pizza, and have 2 or more meals that aren't drier than your nana's va-jay-jay. \n In today's modern age of the webbernets, it is also possible to place your order online from any location and have it ready for pick up when you drop by the store.  So long as you have wi fi, you can have pizza at your finger tips for the small inconvenience of picking it up at the store. \n Or you can use a phone to place the order. \n Also, I can come up with reasons all night long on why a grown person shouldn't be eating - or ordering - a puny ass personal pizza from Pizza Hut.", "What you wear is entirely your choice, which means it reflects your personality. \n Brands aside, people see you differently if you wear floral print Hawaiian shirts everyday or Black shirts with sarcastic phrases in them or v-necks etc. Your hat(s), accessories, shirts, pants, shoes, and anything else you wear all make a statement about you. \n If you wear a food stained shirt and torn blue jeans, people get a different impression of you than if you wear a properly fitted suit.

In my first game of DotA I played as the gambler (and got wrecked of course), and I thought I might have some perspective on this.  I don't expect the changes to be reversed any more than they already have \u2014 there are a lot of reasons for the change \u2014 but I hope that maybe someone will understand. \n Back almost a decade ago DotA was Hard.  It was brutally, uncompromisingly, soul-crushingly  hard .  If you denied a creep you completely denied it.  The other guy got  nothing .  You could be level 6 when the other guy was level 2, and consequently  you  could be level 2 when the other guy was level 6.  It was a system that punished tiny mistakes severely.  If you were even slightly out of position against es (earth shaker, the other ones didn't exist), you died.  You didn't have a stick as a safety belt.  If you didn't get the last hit on the tower your team got no gold whatsoever.  Every small thing you did right could lead to a massive advantage and every small thing you did wrong could crush you eventually. \n That was DotA, and (for me, at least) it existed in a world of systems that were designed to make things  easy , to make sure everyone has a chance to win, \u201cA's for everyone!,\u201d where you get a trophy for participation.  I played soccer growing up in one of those leagues, and even though we were undefeated almost every season, I only kept 3 of the \u201ctrophies\u201d from that (first, last, and one that I like the design of), because they don't really mean anything.  They're for participation.  We could have showed up, lost 10-0 (At most.  \u201cMercy\u201d rules.), and still gone to a pizza party at the end.  School's the same, you check off the boxes and you get an \u201cA.\u201d  The systems were designed so that everyone could be a \u201cwinner.\u201d \n DotA was NOT designed so that everyone could be a winner.  The better player won, and could win with almost anything.  If you fucked up you fucked up HARD not only were you worse off, but the other guy was better off.  And he  stayed  better off, so that if you were able to come back from that it was glorious.  I still remember a game where a few minutes in I was a level 2 dk trying to last hit and deny against a level 6 drow and we were able to bring it back and win.  If you're reading this you've probably been in a game where your team made a miraculous comeback, and you know how satisfying it is.  The reason it's that satisfying is  because you know how hard it is .  And at the same time, you've probably been in a game where you were stomping, which is satisfying precisely because you earned it.  You're ahead because you played better (unless you got gifted,  fagot . \n So when Merlini comes back after the other team has mega creeps for like fucking 20 minutes, he did that because he's GOOD at DotA.  There's no goddamned \u201ccomeback mechanic\u201d to help him.  You can point out that pl's old configuration is in a sense a \u201cmechanic\u201d that allowed that to happen, and fair enough.  But it's not like any old guy can just do that.  Almost everything about the game was working against him.  He had just a tiny sliver of control and he used it to wrest the game into the win column.  There are only a handful of people in the entire world who could have won that game.  He won despite everything working against him  because he played well  and no one, not even his own superego, can take that away. \n Some people on here are saying that people who don't like the bounty change must have lost when they were ahead.  The question is what is the meaning of the win?  The worst thing I've seen after the change is people saying that they won, but they didn't feel like they deserved it.  Fuck that.  If I wanted a \u201cwin\u201d that I didn't have to try for I could go to work where if I follow an algorithm the work gets done.  Having agency means having the possibility of fucking up and losing. \n Probably some people will quit or play dota 2 a lot less after the change.  I'm probably going to still play, because it is a fun game and it's something I can do with old friends despite our now living thousands of miles apart.  But if the game is helping me to come back, it won't feel like dota anymore.

If a reporter wants to interview you, they already have some idea of where you're going to fit into the final piece. \n Consider [Francis]( being invited to talk to MSNBC.  He very wisely declined the interview because he was worried that he was going to be portrayed as hateful, which he clearly isn't. \n The narrative the reporter wanted to set up is pretty clear: three reasonably attractive women are anti-gamergate and then there's this fat guy.  It doesn't matter that Francis is a great guy.  He's funny, articulate and smart, but in that story all he'd be is a fat guy.  It wouldn't have mattered what he said or how he said it.  He fit the narrative of gamergate being about angry fat white men.  It doesn't even matter that francis isn't angry, you find a video of him from his channel and BOOM! for the purposes of the story, \"Let's watch a video of you...\"  \"Now, that doesn't seem like you're very X, now does it?\"  \"Alright, then, if you say so (or something else dismissive)\" \n When he backed out he suggested the reporter talk to [based mom]( instead.  But she didn't fit the narrative of gamergate being angry fat white men, and because of that she had to not exist for the purpose of the story.  And therefore, she got 2 minutes compared to the 60 the other people interviewed received. \n This doesn't mean don't do interviews, but it does mean that if you do you should try to figure out what narrative the reporter is going to go with and present a counter-view.  For instance, Francis could mention his wife and focus on the ways in which he's a family man (something that  Kim Dotcom .", "One of the first summaries I came across was [this one]( which lists some of the incidents that lead to Gamergate.  None of these are about SJW's trying to force their ideology into games, but are about \u201cactual\u201d corruption.  There's also [this article]( from Techraptor that talks about the censorship surrounding a false DMCA claim, which was the thing that swayed me, that's absolutely bullshit, is insanely corrupt, and  really  affects people's lives. \n Though SJW's are often annoying, and sometimes more than annoying, focusing on them does seem (to me) to be a side-track.  I won't go so far as to say that it's an attempt to co-opt gamergate, but I thought gamergate was about \u201cactual\u201d corruption: bribes and kickbacks for connected people, censorship and threats for those with less power. \n Focusing on SJW's also makes gamergate easier to dismiss.  Most people assume various groups to try to influence media to get a \u201cbetter representation\u201d of their group, and therefore think it's \u201cnormal\u201d no matter how artistically damaging it may be.  This has been happening in print media and television for decades.  What SJW's are doing will not be called shitting on someone else's lawn, but \u201cgaming finally growing up\u201d or whatever. \n Along with this, remember that most people who read old media never (literally never) interact with SJW's, allowing old media to frame SJW's however best fits their propaganda.  It's like the recent episode of Southpark where Cartman is pretending to be trans to get his own bathroom, \u201cThis is not a child confused about their identity, this is  Cartman .\u201d \u201cYes, but they don't know that.\u201d", "One of the best resources on Propaganda is the classic, \u201cPropaganda: the formation of men's attitudes.\u201d  In it, Jacques Ellul discusses the two types of propaganda: propaganda of agitation and propaganda of integration.

The high-profile case of shoddy reporting at Rolling Stone and the CBS correspondent being pushed out of her job at the administration's request are certainly just small glimpses at a much larger iceberg. \n - \n An interesting (though rather unsurprising) thing about the MSM's propaganda is that it is almost entirely propaganda of integration.  It seeks to make a person think how good of a person they are for being \u201cthis way\u201d and how bad other people are for being \u201cthat way\u201d  (Protip: this is part of the reason why  sjw's are so incredibly racist and sexist  some action, it is as a \u201cway of life\u201d rather than a one-time \u201cextraordinary\u201d measure. \n - \n Gamergate has achieved some modest success already.  Most of this was on the back of successful agitation campaigns that pressured advertisers to withdraw from particularly crooked sites.  If gamergate is going to transition into a group of watchdogs for the long-term (which I specifically remember was not the goal when it started, or even as recently as a month ago), we will need to take repeated actions that keep games media to task, and that push back against sjw encroachment. \n - \n At the core of this transition will be knowing that things we could be doing on an ongoing basis.  What things can we easily incorporate into our daily lives for instance, reading and linking to better games media, like techraptor, or engaging with media sites/advertisers when they do shitty things (emails, \u201copen letters,\u201d blog posts, etc)? \n -"]}]}

Their guidelines are so inflexible that they sometimes end up walking in circles until they die if the chemical trails they follow get mixed up. \n > Any disagreements here would simply be a semantic dispute over the definition of \"morality.\" \n Then we first need to define morality.  I define it as a top-level set of oughts from which all other oughts are derived. \n I'm convinced that these oughts are subjective but generally common among humans because of our shared evolutionary history as a social species shaping our brains into ones that feel pleasure when doing acts generally considered moral and that feel bad when doing acts generally considered immoral. \n > What moral theory do you subscribe to? How do you generally model your behavior? \n To do what feels right to me at the time. \n I'm not going to criticize the basis or validity of your moral theory for it being subjective or arbitrary. \n Good, because I don't think it can be anything other than subjective and arbitrary (without supernatural influence, perhaps). \n > If your answer to question 1 was not something like \"I act in a way that gives me the most happiness\", then why not? \n In a sense, it is, but not in the typical hedonistic sense of \"happiness\".  Feeling like I've done the right thing is a type of pleasure, and feeling guilt is a type of pain.  I (or anyone else) can't control which actions make us feel these feelings.  I couldn't decide \"I'm going to torture a kitten and feel good about it today\".  Doing so would cause me pain and bring me no pleasure, so I don't do it.  Helping people brings me pleasure and often very little pain (slight inconvenience), and I weigh out whether the pleasure of \"I did the right thing\" is worth that level of pain. \n > If you are given the option of two actions with neither being objectively more moral than the other, then you should always choose the action that promotes your happiness. \n I may be able to be convinced that you  will  choose that action.

I (and most humans) typically do because we evolved to do so. \n > I argue that happiness is the only thing that a person should promote (since everyone wants happiness) without objective morality; acting in any other way would be irrational. \n Only if a person takes as one of their morals (my definition) that one should promote that which gives the most people what they want.  Without a stated goal, acting in any way is  arational , not irrational. \n > For example, imagine you saw someone drop their wallet, and that you could take the wallet for yourself without being detected.

If it were over $10,000, I probably wouldn't even if I were friends with the rightful owner.  If it were over $100,000, there's nobody I would return it to. \n There's a certain amount of pain I'd experience by keeping the wallet, because my brain evolved to feel pain in response to certain things that affect society.  All things equal, I'd like to avoid that pain.  But all things aren't equal.  There's also the pleasure of \"now I have money\".  Which of these two wins out depends on only two factors.

Another  reddit post where someone apparently attacks the police and then wonders why things get worse for them. And when it's someone in the houses' word against the police?

At least, we'll pretend it is so we can get on with the hate. \n Which makes it about as relevant as collidge pointing out that a thousand people dying in police custody in the UK as if that has  any connection  (while also failing to list that the number has been arrived at after three  decades ). \n And it's quite easy to suggest that much of the violence has been wholly unprovoked - in short, you're suggesting that officers act like this  out of the blue , with no provocation or reason. Just in that guardian article, there's a story about a man being hit over the head with an American-style baton 'out of the blue'. Again, in central London I've seen lots of people getting arrested, but not in the manner of beating them senseless  first . \n Now here's another point - have you ever met  anyone  who tells a story about being beaten up 'because they were being an idiot'? No, no-one  ever  gets into stupid fights - they were walking home and twenty guys jumped on them at the chip shop, out of the blue. And likewise, almost everyone who loses in fights with police (which would be almost all of them) will claim police brutality, innocence, anything other than 'yeah, I thought it was a good idea at the time'. \n Obviously this doesn't cover all incidents, but while there will always be one or two bad apples in police terms, this is very, very rarely the case. You have to look at how many people will shout 'OW, YOU'RE HURTING MY ARM' or any number of other stupid excuses when they're arrested,  especially  on film. Are there any guidelines on how to tell if someone is being genuine? Because in nearly every case, they're not. So do you expect the police to do their job, or err on the side of caution just in case? \n Remember the guy that died in UK police custody, lying on the floor saying 'call me an ambulance', and the policeman says 'you're an ambulance'? That's not a policemen laughing at someone dying - that's a policeman who's heard it hundreds  if not thousands  of times already. And yet, when this sort of thing happens, the media are shocked,  shocked , because you might then buy their paper. And it's much easier with a bogeyman in the frame as opposed to asking 'why does every person cry wolf when this is the end result?'."]}]}

Without a reboot, you would NEVER see another adventure of Dr Mcoy or Scotty.", "Excellent post. \n I want to say a few things. \n 1) I loved the new JJ Trek movie. Who else was going to give us our final Nimoy-Spock sendoff? Nimoy had no intention of reprising Spock, but JJ managed to get him back. Regardless of how you feel about Spock's appearance in ST6, wasn't it awesome to see an old friend one last time? \n 2) EVERYONE benefits from JJ Trek. Remember how dead Trek was after Enterprise was canceled? Now, the old shows are being dusted off and resold to the new fans coming in. We benefit from the awesome new Blu Ray upgrades that STTNG is getting, and I'd bet money we'll eventually get DS9 and VOY. Which brings me to my next point: \n 3) Paramount see's there's still money to be made from Star Trek! So what's to say we don't eventually get another Star Trek TV show after JJ's trilogy is over? A lot of people called for Trek to get a rest after ENT, now it looks like the public at large is sending the wake-up call! \n 4) About ENT - that theme song was bad. I don't care that it was different, my dislike had nothing to do with the fact that it was different. It was bad to a lot of people. Not everyone likes schmaltzy 90's pop songs. It doesn't matter how \"appropriate\" the lyrics might be to the situation, it's the execution of it that sucks. Why not a rap song? Or a country song? Or even Disco? Whatever style of song you go with, you will  never  please everyone, and people who don't like that style of music are going to be put off. Would Star Wars still be the phenomenon it is today if it was all disco instead of classical music themes? (which was what Lucas originally envisioned). If they chose a song I liked, maybe I personally wouldn't have been  as  hard on it. But that song was cringe-inducing, mamby-pamby \"we're so full of ourselves\" drek. Being different doesn't make it bad, the song they chose was what made it bad. \n 5) The people expecting so much of \"their\" Trek in it (which is funny, because it's a lot of things to a lot of people) are going to find fault no matter what. \n 6) JJ Trek was FAR superior to the first season of STTNG, and look at how awesome TNG evolved into being! Which brings me to my next point: \n 7) JJ Trek had a LOT to accomplish in just one movie! A LOT of people who watched it were new to Trek. Obviously, Trek fans alone can't sustain a Trek movie alone, otherwise Nemesis wouldn't have been the last TNG film. But TOS had 79 episodes to find it's feet and introduce it's characters and concepts to us. A lot of what we know about Klingons, Vulcans, even Starfleet was not introduced during the first 2 hours of TOS, some of it took a few seasons! But the diehards expect everything handed to them in a fresh reboot which just isn't going to happen. Unrealistic expectations, people! \n In summary: different does not mean bad. OP's point about Batman is a good one, to a degree. I enjoy different interpretations, but I don't need Trek rebooted as frequently as Batman is :). But compare Star Wars to Star Trek. As much as nostalgia plays a part in our enjoyment of new versions of old favorites, it's all a matter of how well things are done. Temper your expectations, don't expect 30+ years of baggage compressed into a 90-minute movie. And realize YOU ALONE are not the only viewer in mind - they need to draw in new fans if any Trek is to be successful. \n I love JJ Trek far more than STV or STTTMP. So what's to say I won't enjoy a future Trek movie more than ST09-JJ?", "I'd have to respectfully disagree. \n I really like the TNG cast. But I really dislike the non-serialized nature of the show. Aside from the top popular episodes that are hailed as TNG's best, the rest of the episodes can be a bit of a chore to rewatch for me. I'm more interested when they bring in the reoccurring regulars like O'Brien on TNG, and especially Q. Otherwise the guest star of the week episodes don't always hold my interest. \n I really prefer the serialized nature of DS9, and the more frequent use of their reoccurring characters such as Gul Dukat, Weyoun, and especially Garak. Every episode has at least one of the semi-regulars on DS9, while it's more of an occasional treat on TNG. \n TNG just has too many \"filler\" episodes. Shows like \"The Survivors\" and \"Remember Me\". etc, aren't terrible, they aren't bad, but they're just not episodes I find myself itching to rewatch. And for every \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" or \"Inner Light\", there are a ton of filler episodes, so the ratio of \"ok\" to \"great\" is a bit skewed, in my opinion. \n TNG really lacks a lot of tension or drama. DS9 has tons of it. How much do you really care what happens to the generic alien culture of the week? When Picard has to mediate between X and Y delegations, I just don't care. I don't know these generic aliens, and we'll never see them again in most cases. Those episodes usually don't help our cast much either. There's little character growth in EVERY episode (not talking about the Data or Worf arcs which you can get from a handful of great episodes, I'm still talking about the filler episodes) Most episodes give the characters something to do by showcasing their hobbies or musical instruments they like to play. Again, no drama or tension. Episodes like \"The Most Toys\" with Data's decision to shoot was  rare . It was the exception, not the rule. \n DS9 had at least the overall tension of \"how can things get worse\" in the region with the Cardassians, the Dominion, etc. I didn't care much for a lot of the Bajoran stuff personally. But there was more incentive to tune in for the next episode. \n As much as I loved TNG, I feel it's best episodes could be put on 2 seasons worth of Blu Rays (52 episodes) out of the total 7 seasons, and even that might be stretching it a bit. DS9  holds my interest longer, and is practically all good from season 3 through 7, with some good stuff still in seasons 1 & 2 sporadically. \n TNG really would have benefited more from more tension and actual character drama. Everyone got along too well. (blah, blah, Gene's Vision, blah blah - but that doesn't account for the McCoy/Spock friendly rivalry, does it? TNG lacks even that playful rivalry among characters, aside from rare instances). I would have loved to see a more overall story with more ongoing \"bad\" characters, like a Dukat or Weyoun type.

Before that, it was more procedural and lacked tension, the rebels just went off to try to blowup the Death Star. She also insisted on keeping in the bit where Chewie scares off the mouse-droid on the Death Star. \n Gary Kurtz. This man was not afraid to tell George when his ideas were bad. The prequels would have been far better with him in place of Rick McCallum. Notice the dropoff in quality in ROTJ? Because Kurtz was tired of fighting with George and moved on to direct The Dark Crystal instead. \n Also, Harrison Ford contributed more than I think we all realize. He changed so much of his own lines, but more than that, he was a ringleader for the other actors to do the same. Mark Hamill was quoted as saying that Ford's advice to him was along the lines of: \"Don't  ask  George to change your lines, just do what you want in front of the camera, he won't notice the difference.\" And as a result, we got far more natural-sounding dialogue compared to the \"shit\" in the script. (Ford's famous line to Lucas was \"George, you can type this shit but you sure can't say it\" - as he has said in a few interviews) \n And of course there's Irvin Kirshner, who, like Ford, I wouldn't call an \"unsung hero\", but I still have to give him props. As the director of Empire, he was also willing to do what he felt he needed to do, rather than being a yes-man to Lucas like ROTJ's director was. IF Empire had been a bad movie, I think that would have killed off the franchise there. We would have still likely gotten ROTJ, but the series would have likely faded after that IF Empire hadn't established SW as a viable series.

Nursing home nurses do not have the same skills as hospital nurses, because they are not exposed to as much variety on such a more frequent basis (this is not meant as an insult to nursing home nurses). How many IV's does a NH nurse start each shift, or even at all? This is almost a daily thing for hospital nurses. Nurses specialize, just like doctors. There are differences in skills between ICU nurses, surgical nurses, tele nurses, dialysis nurses, etc, etc. \n And how many times in the hospital does the nurses  change ??? If you've ever been in the hospital, how many different nurses have been assigned to you while you were there? We generally only work 3days/week on average, not always in a row, and can have different assignments each day! The doctor will stay the same 99% of the time! \n But the biggest thing you fail to realize is that the doctor is ultimately legally responsible for the patient. And since you want to use the hospital setting as an example when we had been discussing the nursing home setting, then let's look at that. The hospital is an acute care setting, meaning the patient is presumed less stable than one in a nursing home. That makes it even MORE dangerous for the doctors who don't actually  SEE  the patients but ONLY look at the chart. And as a NURSE (assuming you are one), you should know that if you are copying someone else's assessment then you are falsifying data and commiting fraud yourself! \n >Also, a 2-year degree doesn't qualify you to do many of the jobs a 4 year nurse can.

I'll have to share this with all of the 2-year nursing degree nurses I know (which is a lot). A 2-year nursing degree is called an associates degree, and yes they have a \"full\" nursing license. 4-year (Bachelor degree) nurses are more for the  administrative  positions, even though hospitals prefer them overall.

There were a few bumps in the road due to studio and actor interference. \n A few characters left or were added. The studio insisted on adding Warren Keffer, the fighter pilot (why does a pilot hang out with the command staff?). JMS hated writing him in. One actor got another job as a news anchor and left the show (won't spoil it here!). But JMS stated he had an \"out\" for every character in case the actor got \"hit by a bus\" or left for any other reason. And truthfully, the actor change from season 1 to season 2 really improved things for what was to come from the characters! \n Sadly, when it looked like season 4 was going to be their last, everything from s5 was crammed in. When they got their last minute renewal, there wasn't much to go with after s4. It did have some great moments though. Thankfully, the finale was filmed at the end of s4 and held back to the end of s5, which is hands down THE finest series finale for any show EVER! But you can't fully appreciate that without having watched the series. It is a true ending, not an open-ended, wait-for-a-sequel thing that other shows give. \n And finally, as far as guest stars go, Walter Koening as Bester is my favorite.

Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski indicated that Paramount was aware of his concept as early as 1989,[56] when he attempted to sell the show to the studio, and provided them with the series bible, pilot script, artwork, lengthy character background histories, and plot synopses for the first 22 episodes.[57][58] Paramount passed on Babylon 5, but later announced Deep Space Nine was in development after Warner Bros. announced its plans for Babylon 5. Straczynski has stated on numerous occasions that he thinks Paramount may have used his bible and scripts as the basis for DS9's first season.\" \n As for the first season, some of it's rough, some of it sucks, but MOST of it is necessary! (SKIP the 1st season episode \"TKO\" though): You get a LOT of ground-work for later on, plus the introduction of Bester, Mr Morden, Zathras, etc, etc. But mainly, the first season provides the scenes of Londo, Vir, and G'Kar. They are what  really  matter in terms of \"no one is what he appears\". They are the ones that develop in ways you do NOT expect based on their 1st season, and for that alone is worth much of the whole series! \n Of course, a lot of ground work is laid out for one character who left later in the show to work for CNN, which was not the show's fault and they had to compensate for it, but they did a better job of it with the replacement character I think. \n For very detailed responses from JMS himself, check out:", "I hate this argument so much! \n You have the option to ignore any sequel you want. If your precious memories are so easily destroyed, just don't watch it! It could just as well be incredible, too! \n But sequels like this benefit everyone who cares.

There's just something about it that I find dull and unappealing. It had a few decent moments, but never enough to keep my interest. The best performance (that I also liked years ago in the theater) was by the actor who played one of the bikers in Sons of Anarchy as the crazy guy who tried to barter for the girls with paper. Maybe it's the editing, maybe it's the writing, maybe it's just the overall pacing of the film, but it just bores me.

(Funny, Star Trek TOS had the same thing happen to it's creator when Lost In Space was born!) \n Having said that, DS9 is my favorite of the Star Treks. The characters are the most developed of any Trek series. Some episodes are boring, but overall it's a great show. My favorite Star Trek episode comes from DS9, \"The Visitor\".

Because it's not just for the cost of the saline. It's to pay everyone involved in your care. The nurse has to start that IV, right? Generally, they don't ring up every piece of gauze, tape or needle used in starting or maintaining that IV.

To me, a couple is engaged when there is a firm decision to get married and concrete plans to do so at a date in the not-too-distant future and you shouldn't get engaged if you are not ready to be married so I'd say around the same ages, maybe a year younger. \n Obviously, there are always exceptions; people who grow up faster for one reason or another (e.g. moved out and became independant earlier due to shitty family, young parents...) or are still way too immature even in their late twenties, early thirties or later.", "If I didn't have a job, I'd have no money with which to travel. \n Not sure this applies to you but 2 misconceptions that keep people from travelling are: \n \n How expensive travelling is. My first travel was at an au pair so my costs were only: a hundred bucks on a plane ticket and then whatever extra travel costs I wanted (like drinks, admission entrance to tourist places...). Food and lodging were free. That's just an example, couchsurf, helpx, wwoof are other ways to save lodging costs. Hostels, air BnB,  or just straight up temporary renting a place are other ways to reduce both food and lodging costs compared to using regular hotels and eating out all the time. Buses, hitchhiking, car sharing... is also cheaper than planes. \n \n That you need to save up enough for your whole trip, then go on your trip, then work some more. When I planned to travel for a year, I saved up for a plane ticket way-and-back and 4 months worth of expenses. The rest, I knew I would need to get during my trip. A lot of people I met had saved less; it just mean they had to find a job sooner or spend less (I ended up starting my first job a month after I arrived but I would have found it stressful to only have one or two months saved up). \n \n \n That's not to say everyone can travel and certainly not that everyone had it as easy as I had. As a white upper middle class person in a western country with free education, good health and awesome parents, I was priviledged in many ways. I absolutely acknowledge that.", "I have always wanted to have two kids by age 30 and marriage, if any, before since I see it as a lesser commitment. That would put it between 26 and 28.

Really? \n >  He had bought me a car a few months back ~10,000 and we had verbally agreed that I would pay about $500 per month until he was paid back. \n You bought a $10 000 car at 18 on a loan. What kind of money were you making at the time that this would be even remotely reasonable? \n > I have signed an agreement saying I'd pay him back the full amount. I have been paying $550/month and I have 10 payments left. \n How the hell are you not done paying it if you pay $500-550 a month and you started 4 years ago? According to you, you still owe him $5500 which is more than half the loan. Either he charged you a lot of interests or you have paid way less than agreed so far. 500$ a month for 4 years is $24 000. On the other hand, $4500 in 3 years is an average of $125 a month. What is going on here? \n > When we broke up, I gave him the ring back but basically ignored him about the car, so he filed a lawsuit. \n You took a loan and promised to pay it back, then you broke up and decided to \"ignore the loan\". I am sorry but I wouldn't want to marry you either; you are just not trustworthy enough in my opinion. Last time you two broke up, you tried to carry off with $10 000 of his money (which was probably all you could access save for the ring); what would you do in a divorce? \n > I bring in about $50,000 \n You claim to be under poverty line when you make $50 000 a year. You spend $50 a month on eating out, $225 on furniture, $100-200 on credit cards (might be necessary or not, what did those buy?), $800 on electricity and groceries, $80 on your phone, sports league... that's not a poverty line lifestyle. Don't make comments about knowing what being poor is with that salary and those expenses. \n That being said, I am also willing to bet that some of those expenses, you wouldn't make if you weren't living with him ($800 on electricity and groceries). It happens sometimes that when two people with a great income-disparity move in, the lower income one is \"forced\" into a higher and more expensive standard of living and ends up living about their means. That's why most couples with huge income disparity don't go 50-50 (even 30-70 is \"not fair\" when you make 20% of the income). \n > Money is extremely tight for me...The lack of financial support also hurts. He constantly brags about how much money HE has to other people and likes to show off and I am worried on a daily basis about an emergency occurring financially \n He is swimming in money and bragging about it when you are struggling and he won't help you. He doesn't offer any support when he could easily do so. I am sorry but he might be your SO or your boyfriend but you are not his partner. Is this the kind of relationship you want to have?  Because that's what it is going to be like with him. Personally, I wouldn't stay. \n > Back to the \"wedding\" The two of us are going to Bermuda and exchanging vows on the beach. At that point we will spiritually call ourselves husband and wife, but there is no paperwork to back any of it up \n And that would be fine but his behavior is not that of a husband. Don't fool yourself by thinking that you are husband-and-wife in all but name. It's not a \"wedding\" (not even with the \"\"); it's just a party and vow exchange. \n > He said once we start having children a few years down the line I can stop working and he will take care of me \n This is a big risk to take. If you give up your job and you two break up, you will have a really hard time. I would not give my job up for someone without some kind of alimony or compensation set-up in case of a break up (not necessarily marriage). \n >  I'm going out on the line and legally changing my last name to his \n No. That's a decision you made for you because you didn't like your name and you wanted to sound married. Don't expect something in return. If he is the one who asked you to, mea culpa but you should have mentioned it. \n . \n It might seem like I put a lot on you (if you only look at quantity) but not supporting you, driving you to a too expensive lifestyle and expecting you to give up your job without any safety are huge deals.", "Well, for your relationship, you will have to talk to her. Just explain what you have told us here and see what she thinks about it. I would recommend mentioning it in your first discussions about moving in so it doesn't come to her like an unpleasant surprise. \n Now for my unsolicited opinion: \n \n That sounds like an expensive arrangement considering you would not sleep in separate rooms most of the time. I completely understand the need for space and in my dream house, I would have my \"man's cave\" (though it would only have a sofa-bed, not a full blown bedroom area) but what you want comes at a price. For instance, in our first apartment, we had a living room(with a sofa bed), a kitchen and a bedroom so if we wanted alone time for one reason or another, we had to go the living room or kitchen. In our current one, we have a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom and an extra room but rent is more expensive. If we wanted to have what you have i.e. two fully furnished bedrooms that are also big enough to double up as a hobby room and office, then that is even more money on rent and furniture. So it depends whether you two have the budget for it and whether that's a priority for you. Personally, while I would love to have my \"man's cave\", I would rather travel so unless we get lots of money, that's not likely to happen. \n \n It sounds like it would create awkward moments. When I am not asleep because I am insomniac or my SO snores or I just don't feel like sleeping right now, I just get up and go in the living room to do my own stuff or I sleep in the guest room. What would I do if we were living together and it's a night when we are in my room? Wake you up and tell you to go back to your room? Catch you before you are fully asleep if you are dozing after sex: \"Hey babe, that was fun but you've got to leave now\"? Likewise, my SO sometimes wakes up crazy early and is incapable of going back to sleep while I like to sleep late when possible so he just gets up and go about his life. I don't mind this. I would not appreciate being woken up and kicked out. \n \n I am curious to know what were your living arrangements with your previous girlfriends. How many rooms did you have and what were the issues?", "She doesn't want us to not share a name, so it's either we take one together, or she takes mine. \n I think that's unfair on your fianc\u00e9e's part. It's fair enough to say \"I don't want to take the name X\" or \"I want us to share a name\" or \"I don't want to hyphenate\"... but not to demand  all  those things at the same time, effectively leaving you with only one option which you don't like (changing your name entirely). \n I think she gets to say \"I don't want the name X\" if she wants. But she needs to realize that you also get a say (in your case \"I don't want to entirely drop name X\") and then she has to be open to a compromise: you each keep your name, she keeps her name and you hyphenate yours, you both hyphenate, you do something with middle names... \n OR she gets to say \"we have to have the same name\" but again, she needs to realize you get a say too and she has to be open to compromise: you both take yours or one or both hyphenate. \n If you go with different names, don't forget to discuss kids names if you want them.", "I find it a bit unfair to represent it like he is unilaterally springing it on her after she moved in and gave up her old place. The initial agreement when she moved in was that the tarantulas would be in the smallest tank and in the basement and I assume OP knew full well his problem with spiders (dating for 3 years + why the basement and small tank requirement otherwise). OP is the one who suddenly changed the terms, though she has valid reasons to do so. \n They should both have discussed it beforehand. It's as much on her as it is on him, maybe even more on her considering that as someone who never owned or considered owning a spider, it would have been a lot harder for him to foresee the basement being too cold issue. \n > The fact is the bf knew she had these spiders when he agreed to the living arrangement \n And OP knew he was scared of them, knew he didn't want them upstairs (which he has compromised on) and knew he wanted them in the smallest tank ever. \n > Honestly if he had that big of a problem with them, then he should have mentioned it before she moved in \n Which he very likely did. \n > As the situation stands he has put her in the position of having to choose between him or the pets, but waited until she would be forced to have to find a new place to live, including deposits and such if she chose to keep the animals she clearly loves. If he was going to put her in that position he should have done it before she gave up her old place. \n He had no clue this issue would arise. He is as much blindsided by it as OP is; probably more because OP had owned tarantulas for 3 years at that point and claims to be very knowledgeable about their needs which he didn't. \n As the situation stands, she has put him in the position of having to live with an animal he is positively scared of in his kitchen, but waited until she was living here and he would be required to kick her out. If she was going to put him in that position, she should have done it before she moved in.", "There is no logic there. Your reasoning is literally: A is an asshole  therefore  B is a decent person. Mmh no, he could be a decent guy with an awful wife or a scumbag with an awful wife. Both proposition make equal sense and are plausible and the other info we have point to scumbag. \n As an aside, if his wife had his but sack in her tightly clenched jaws, OP would not even exist. This man is a  serial  cheater which means several times his excessively controlling hateful wife forbid him to have that kind of contact with women and several times he did anyways.

Saving money to have enough for school yes; but she doesn't want to cover her own expenses. She won't even cover a proportionate amount of her expense. \n > $500 can be a big part of that monthly salary. \n No. It's 10% of her income before tax; 13% of her  monthly salary after tax. For comparison, OP would be paying well over that even if she contributed 500$. \n > She may have thought that by moving in with you it would be easier for her to save money. \n And she does save money. She is saving an extra 500$ a month / 6 000$ a year (a big part of her salary according to you). I can guarantee she is also saving on food. \n She wants to save money but she isn't willing to make any efforts for it. She wants to save money by having OP pay her way. For instance,  she refuses to save on rent and utilities by having a roommate; she demands to save on rent and utilities by OP covering 70-80% of her rent.  She is not trying to save money on outings by suggesting less or cheaper dates; she saves by OP paying 90% on dates.", "I just think that if everyone could turn their back on Ashley without a second thought, what stops then from doing it to me? \n Nothing. In all likelihood, they would cut you out of their lives. \n You are not their daughter and you are not their direct family. You are their daughter  in-law , their family  in-law . This means that you became part of their family, you have a relationship with them, through your relationship with your fiance. You can view it as a chain: You are related to your fianc\u00e9 and your fianc\u00e9 is related to his family: your family <-> you <-> your fianc\u00e9 <-> his family. If you divorce or don't work out, if you break that link with your fiance, then you will cease being family to them: your family <-> you // your fianc\u00e9 <-> his family. \n Does it suck? Could it be different? Is their attitude to Ashley kinda shitty in the circumstances? Yes, absolutely. But that is the reality. \n Now what you do with this info is up to you but I would consider two things. The first is how quick you seem to be ready to discard your relationship and the man you promised to live your life with for something  his family  did and on which he has no control whatsoever. The second is that you might find that the situation is the same in a number of families. \n As for Ashley, I would reach out to her and encourage your fiance to do the same. She is going through some tough times and I am sure your support would mean a lot to her.", "Understandably so, my dad wanted to make sure that we wouldn't be struggling right after we get married; \n When I read this part, my first thought was \"I don't find it all that understandable that your parents would have a say in when you get married, much less veto power, but if you are both fine with that, good for you\". \n Except that as I went on, it became not so clear whether your boyfriend is fine with that. There is nothing wrong in itself in wanting your parents to be a part of your marriage and have a day in it - though I personally would never accept that and you'd be hard pressed to find a partner who does in my culture. But there is a strong possibility that this is not what your SO wants and if he wants a twosome while you want a foursome, this is a major issue that needsi be resolved before anything else and certainly before you can plan to get married. \n > After that, it was like war and I was caught in the middle \n That is the second thing that stood out to me. I can't imagine saying \"there was a war and I wasn't on my SO's side\" because we are a team. I would strongly urge you to reflect on what marriage means to you in that regard. \n > I was miserable planning the day that should be one of the happiest in my life. \n Correct me if I am wrong but this man will also be present in that day and he happens to also get married in this day.

It's interesting that people will self select for other people who will lie to them in order to sleep with them, but reject honest and upfront people. \n You were honest and upfront and they rejected you but they did not reject you  because  of your honesty nor did they select against honest or upfront people. The same could be said of people who refuse to sleep with non cis-people, people with STD, people who won't do this or that act or like OP, people who are just interested in a fling. We all have criterion for our relationship; that criterion is not dishonesty but it can result in selecting a liar who pretend to meet our criterion. This doesn't mean we are \"self selecting for liars but rejecting honest and upfront people\". \n While \"having fun\", would you have slept with a woman who told you that she wanted to get pregnant as soon as possible through any possible mean? If not, the same could be said of you: you would reject honest and upfront women while selecting lying and manipulative ones.", "I was a bit shocked by his attitude and I don't think you are unreasonable but I'll still try to get you to understand his point of view. \n You and him have an agreement and it's already one in which he pays more and then every now and then, he pays a bit more than he should: a coffee here, a dinner there... It seems pretty insignificant at the time but it adds up. It can easily be over a thousand in a year. And since you are already supposed to pay for food, entertainment and going out, it pretty much only goes one way. It's also a personality thing. Some people are anal about everything, they like to keep track of everything, be very exact and precise to make sure the situation is fair. \n What I would suggest is maybe opening a joint account for those expenses you already agreed to share: rent, groceries, going out to eat/entertainment, electricity, internet, parking, renter\u2019s insurance. On the first of the month, he puts in $1200 and you put in whatever your share of the expenses are - as a side note, I am curious to know (1) if you know how much you spend (2) what it is, compared to his $1200. This way, he can get you a latte or pay for dinner if you forgot your wallet with money you earned. It respects your agreement to the penny but without any graceless keeping track and tit-for-tat. On the contrary, it should make you feel less like roommates and more like a team, which is where your current issue is. \n It will also make him (and possibly you) see exactly how much you spend each month so he can realize he is actually not paying that much more. This in terms could lead to re-discussing your initial agreement. If you earn less, are already in full time job + full time school, pay nearly as much and do all the cooking, cleaning and I am going to guess you are mostly the one to go grocery shopping if you pay for food (or maybe you go together), then it doesn't sound really fair to me. I would say the best options in your case would be either (a) you move to a cheaper place and do 50/50 or (b) you stay in the more expensive place but he pays more (proportionally to your incomes or a set amount). Either way, you should discuss it in numbers rather than in bills and that's made easier with a joint account. Then if you two choose (b) and you feel you have to do more to compensate, then you have a clear image of the amount of money you are compensating for."]}]}

(YEAAH) \n My GCSE French teacher decided to go on an international exchange to Australia for a year.  She and her family would go there and live in a house and work the jobs of a family there and then they would come here (UK) and do the same thing.  We were thinking that we'd get some bronzed, surfer-dude Australian sex-god for a year to teach us French.  Instead we got this fat, middle-aged Romanian alcoholic we shall call Mr Viola. \n This guy regularly bragged to us how much wine he had drunk over the weekend, even telling us a story about how he had stolen his neighbour's daughter's pink children's bike to cycle to the shop to get more wine because he was too drunk to drive.  He boasted that he had certificates of fluency in 6 languages and English wasn't one of them (we could believe THAT).  He constantly sweated and wore the same shirt all week, which now I think about it, is one of the signs of an alcoholic right?  He stank, and kept his classroom's heating on so the room stank of him too. \n We exacted our revenge by altering his language.  Not obvious, but things that were hilarious.  \"Barrow-wheel\", \"webcob\", it was alarming to hear him scream  \"STOP JIGGLING! YOU WERE LITTLE ANGLES A MOMENT AGO!\"  at 12 year olds.  He once sent a girl out of the classroom for her chair breaking.  She wasn't even fat or anything.  The screws that fixed the chair to the legs had been loosened, she leaned back and the entire thing came apart.  She hit her head on the windowsill, and got sent outside.  Later her mum had to take her to the hospital for concussion. \n I think it was this that got him observed, though I'm not sure.  A sub sat in his class and watched him.  The guy  freaked .  He only would answer questions from his favourite students.  He yelled at us for the smallest thing.  Sent a boy to the head-teacher when the kid had had his hand up for 20mins to ask a question.  When he got bored he waited until it was quiet and then shouted it out.  Mr Viola flipped.  He was being observed.  We had a new teacher on the Monday after. \n It was too late though, 3 months of his terrible teaching had taken it's toll.  I dropped from an A grade to a D grade.  Because of other problems (the new teacher got a better job so ditched us after another 3 months.  The other French teacher in the school went on maternity leave and the only other alternative was the German teacher who got a crash-course in French so he could teach us instead) I ended up only getting a 'C'.", "This one came up in convo recently actually.

He first picked them up from the airport 3 hours away and drove them all the way to La\u0161ko, the city.  The taxi driver was specially asked for as he was fluent in Russian and German. \n Anyhow, the Russian decides he likes the driver and requests him everyday from then on to pick up his wife from the hotel at 9am or so to take her into town.  He's then requested at 3pm everyday to take her from the town to the hotel.  Every time he returns the wife to the hotel, the husband tips him 5euro.  For a 10euro trip, the driver thinks this is pretty good.  It goes on like this for about 3 or 4 days.  The driver gets to know the lady quite well, and through her, her husband.  The Russian is a well-off guy, decent, upstanding, hard-working.  Each day she goes to the city to shop, he's back at the hotel, working.  Good husband, gentle father.  Well-respected by their friends and neighbours. \n Then on the 5th day, after the driver has dropped off the wife, he gets a call on the dispatch: can he return to the hotel please?  The driver gets nervous, he likes the husband and wife and wonders what the Russian could possibly want - if he's done anything wrong.  He returns to the hotel, picks up the Russian and they set off.  He's just driving for a bit, not really thinking about where the guy needs to go.  Finally the Russian says: \"You are a good man, I am happy to have met you.  I hope you can help.  I've been stuck in that damn hotel room for too many days.  Each day my wife comes home and shows me what else she has spent my money on.  Today she is out suitcase shopping, because we realised we can't take all the things she's bought in the town home with us.  I can't believe it.  She's never been this bad.  I need to relax.  I hope you know where I can go to relax.\"  The driver keeps quiet, he knows where this is leading, but doesn't want to make assumptions.  \"Do you know anywhere that some ladies will help me relax and forget my wife's bills?\" \n The driver takes him to a house of repute, as the Russian is getting out the car he says; \"here is the money I owe you for now, stay here and keep the meter running.  I may be a while, but I don't want to have to wait for you to return when I come out.\"  The driver is sat in the car for 3 hours.  The Russian is returned to the hotel and tips him 100euro.  The driver then fetches the wife from town and doesn't say a word to her.  The rest of the holiday passes as it did before.  When he takes them to the airport at the end of the week or two weeks, the Russian gives him a big hug, says thank you and the wife tips him another 50euro out of her pen money.  The Russian is so surprised, \"You must be a good man for my wife to pay you!  What have you been doing with her?\"  Winks and leaves."]}, {"subreddit": "TalesFromRetail", "posts": ["I got called one of these 'Entitled University Students' in my last job, and was one of a plethora of reasons I left that position. \n The fact was I was treated as an outcast from the get-go.

We only can accept passports, drivers licences and something called a 'citizen card', all of which have to have this hologram to say they're kosher. If I fail to do this and sell alcohol to someone underage or buying for someone underage, not only will my work get fined \u00a330,000 and lose their alcohol selling licence, but I also would be fined \u00a35,000 personally. As you can imagine, this is quite the incentive not to make a mistake. \n So this group of 4 or 5 lads comes through my till. It's not so busy so they begin loading up the conveyor with items, including a massive 24can box of beer and a few more glass bottles of cider etc. Now, they all look around 18 to 19, but as they look under 25 I steel myself to ask for Id. The first one loads up the alcohol, a pizza and some other things. All this time I'm sat about 4 feet away listening as they discuss 'do we have enough alcohol?' 'Will it last the weekend between all of them?' 'I don't like this type, can we get more of the other?' Etc. I'm fairly patient and we weren't particularly busy at that point so I didn't mind the wait. \n The first one comes through with all the alcohol for the group and I ring the pizza and other non-alcohol items through, but then put my hand on the box of cans and ask for Id. The first guy hands me a drivers licence and the date shows he's only been 18 for about a month or so. I hand it back to him and wait. The others just look at me. \n \"sorry if you're buying this together I need to see everyone's I'd.\" they all look a bit uncomfortable for a moment until the guy at the front says \"oh no, this alcohol is just for me.\" I look at the beers and then incredulously back at him and say 'you expect me to believe that you're buying 24 beers, 8 ciders and a massive bote of vodka just for yourself while staying for a weekend holiday with your mates?' He flipped out (I shouldn't have said that, but I literally couldn't believe he thought I was that stupid) and began ranting about he  had  to have it because he was the customer and I was just an idiot country bumpkin and who the hell did I think I was? I was totally shocked by his outburst and calmly explained all about the me being charge \u00a35,000 if I sold it to him and he gave it to someone underaged. He truly lflipped out at this point and began swearing at me, threw the pizza in my face, and I turned to see the other boys looking shocked and ashamed of their friend's behaviour. \n At this point my supervisor came over and said that if he behaved like that she'd have him banned from our store. He didn't really listen as he was still ranting, but ended with a triumphant '...and how the hell can you prove it's not just for me?!' \n I blinked a couple times and looked again at his mated, who stood there in embarrassment (at this point other customers has also stopped to watch the tirade) and I said 'I could hear when you asked them of they thought it was enough for all of you to drink while you put everything on my till.' I've never avtually seen someone deflate until then. He stalked out of the store raving about how he was never going to shop here again, leaving his items and all the alcohol on the till for me to put away. His mates all were silent as I served them, and the best bit was when he had to return to the store because he didn't have the car keys and it was raining in torrents outside. \n While he sat at the end of my till, glaring at me the entire time, his last friend came through and as he was paying said 'I'm sorry for my friend. He can be a massive dickhead at times, but he's not entirely a bad guy. Even I know we aren't worth \u00a35,000 for your trouble.' As he walked past his friend, he said loudly 'yeah you better be sulking, arrogant prick.' They all left without any more hassle. \n The worst thing about the incident is that the store policy changed by the next season I worked so that only the person who was paying had to provide Id, even though this was against the law, as the store manager said it was 'too much hassle' to ask for everyone's Id.", "I work in a supermarket.  This is one of those good stores where they don't just shove you in one dept and leave you there to rot.  They train you in everything you think you're capable of.  The two things they train everyone in is shelf-stacking and check-outs, but there's also warehouse/delivery, deli, hotfoods, bakery and a cafe, as well as informal supervisors of each area. \n It's a seriously touristic area and each summer season they employ between 3 and 12 new staff for summer cover.  This year they had the budget to hire about 10 new staff.  I was one of them.  I've been in the job before in college, and after moving back after uni I applied again as a time filler and to earn a little money.  The people I work with are on the whole great, and I'm relaxed enough to not give a shit about the ones I don't like.  The work, however, is gruelling.  It's mind numbingly simple and boring and repetitive. \n So how could anyone be bad at it? \n There are people who are purposefully bad, antisocial, grumpy etc, just can't be bothered to do the job.  But this summer I met a guy called Marcos who was personable, entertaining, pleasant, polite and  totally shit at his job .  My mind still boggles at his ineptitude, but here is a comprehensive list of sceanarios he has found himself in. \n \n My first inkling that he might not be brilliant was late one night when we were facing up (bringing everything to the front of the shelves) the store.  We'd done the awkward bits like the alcohol, non-food and chilled and only had the simple cereals, biscuits, bottles and crisps left.  Marcos and I teamed up to tackle each aisle together and just chat as we were on the home stretch of the night.  As we were talking, he'd say 'hold on' and walk away from me, only to return a few moments later.  At first I thought he was putting items customers had misplaced back where they should be, but he was doing it too often.  I finally asked him what he was doing and he just said 'there are a lot of suspicious customers around tonight'.  I stared at him, full realisation dawning on me.  Every time he'd disappeared he'd been  following customers around the store .  He then went on to explain that he wanted to be a Police Officer... \n \n He turned up drunk to work.  He'd been drinking the night before not realising he had a shift the next morning (we're given our rotas 3 weeks in advance) so instead of phoning in sick/trying to swap with someone, he turned up after a bender still drunk.  Within an hour he was sent away again. \n \n The tills didn't want him because he kept making mistakes that the supervisors had to rectify.  We have a constant 'deal' where if you buy 4 bread rolls then they're \u00a31.  There are about 16 different types of rolls in different shapes that come under the offer.  He wouldn't put the proper bread roll in the system, just put 4 of the plain white bread rolls through his till.  As a result our system would show that we'd sold more plain white bread rolls than we'd made and we needed to waste off many non-existent speciality rolls.  Another reason is he somehow (and I still don't know how he possibly could manage this) would cause tons of refunds.  I once came on shift to a super who was fuming and asked to take 5 mins to calm down when she saw me.  It took a while to get the story from her, but apparently all morning there's only been her and Marcos on checkouts, and in the last hour alone he'd cause 5 refunds.  Our average for the day was around 5 refunds and they mostly were customers realising they've picked up the wrong item.  These were items Marcos had scanned through twice and charged the customer without noticing/bothering to tell the customer. \n \n We are only allowed to have max \u00a3150 in notes in our tills at any one time.  All excess notes are put into a secure box beside us that no-one but the manager and supervisor has access to, and they have to go get keys and paperwork to remove it.  Once I went on to a till after him to find over \u00a3800 in twenties alone.  I didn't count the \u00a310s.  When I informed my super, they instantly called him in th back and gave him an earful. \n \n He left work 3 hours early once.  Everyone was rushed off their feet, everyone had a job to do.  We were stretched as we usually are.  He didn't say bye to anyone, just left.  When someone noticed, he was called up and asked where he was.  He was playing PlayStation at home and came back to finish his shift.  He said it was an honest mistake, but again he obviously wasn't reading his timetable properly.  Besides, it was a Sunday and there's only 2 kinds of shift given on Sundays: 10am - 4pm or 8am - 12pm (store is open 10am to 4pm). He had done these shifts for several weeks and knew the system, yet he still went home at 1pm and didn't think anything of it. \n \n He began using someone else's login to authorise underage people's age related sale.  I heard about this one, but it was pretty big news.  It's a big complicated, but I'll try my best.  Everyone in our store has an 8 digit login to remember.  The first 4 numbers everyone knows, the last 4 are your password and absolutely no one else is to know this number.  In our system we have to 'guess' the age of the customer and type it into our screen.  If we type in a number lower than 25 (age we have to ID to) then it'll prompt us to ask for ID and what type of ID they provide.  It flags anyone who uses the same 'guessed age' over and over.  If you're under the age of 18 or you are on trial (like Marcos was) then you have to get a supervisor to put their personal ID in to okay the sale.  He got flagged for using the same 'guessed age' to the supervisors on the system, who took a look at his age-related sales activity and noticed something disturbing.  Only 2 people had been authorising the sales.  Even when they weren't on shift.  What's worse, he was observed entering an authorisation code for another new member of staff who was underage.  He had watched as 2 other staff members had put their codes into the system, memorized them, and been using them to authorise not only his own sales, but also this underage staff member's sales.  All 4 of them were called in.  There was massive hubbub, couple of people were suspended including Marcos, and whole store was in uproar because the two codes he used were of permanent staff members. \n \n The straw that broke the camel's back: he was allowed back from suspension before the others.  On his second day back his till was \u00a370 down.  The only way this was possible was either he took the money himself (which I doubt because he was still set on the whole Police Officer thing) or he gave money as cashback without actually putting it through the till... more than once as we're only permitted to give max \u00a350 cashback (if he knew that).  He was fired on the spot and the following week I had a nice amount of extra hours waiting for me. \n \n \n So these are the tales of the worst employee ever.  The best thing is that according to our personnel manager, Marcos scored as one of the highest aptitudes as an interviewee.  Just goes to show those things are terrible.", "So basically I've only ever had a couple of complaints or bad customers who left the store unhappy, and most of the time they left due to nothing that was my fault.  I've had plenty of people come unhappy to my till and I can just TELL they're itching to complain about something.  Most of the time they've had a bad day and are impatient and my chirpy attitude has gotten to them and they can't deal. \n When I see trouble brewing I compliment them.  I pick out something they are wearing and say that it's pretty (women) or dapper (men) and (this is the important thing)  get them talking about it .  As soon as the focus is off something they're unhappy about, and you get them chatting about something they love (if they say they don't like the thing they're wearing ask them why not and focus on the type of thing they do like) they usually chill out and forget they were upset at all. \n Now for the story, called  The Time I Actually Called a Customer Out on his Assholery \n It was a pretty slow weekday, and for once we were overstaffed (don't remember the reason right now) so it meant that everywhere we had a cage of items to put onto the shelving we had about 5 members of staff working it.  Also, because we had so few customers in the store, only the minimum check-out staff were still on the tills - i.e. one on the kiosk and one on the main-line - me. \n The nearest cage was in the fresh section, nearby the kiosk and I could see them from my till.  I was aware that one of the few customers in the store at that moment was a family with children doing what looked like their holiday weekly shop.  They looked nearly ready to head to the checkouts but weren't going to be there that second, and I needed to ask my supervisor a question, so I hopped off the till, went the 20yards to the kiosk where there was 6 members of staff milling around one cage but always within earshot of each other so therefore chatting while they worked.  I asked my question, got the response and turned to see the family with the trolley looking around for where they should go to pay.  I apologised and rushed back to the till, asking them all the basic questions.  I heard the father mutter under his breath \"lazy staff standing around doing nothing.  Does it really take seven people to fill one shelf?\"  I shot him a look and he realised I'd heard and shut up. \n I carried on serving them, catering to the children and conversing with the wife, all smiles.  Finally I said to him, as they had so much shopping I had the ability to wait, \"I'm sorry I made you wait for the till to open, I was only gone for a second to ask my boss a question.\" \n Him: \"It wasn't you, it just makes me wonder why they need so many people to do the same job and they don't have any tills open to cater for the customers.\" \n Me:  \"We did have this one open, it never closed.  I just was gone for a moment.  And they are all working that cage because it's slow today and we've had a delivery.  We can't keep tills open when there are no customers to serve.\" \n Him: \"Well, in my work we never have quiet times like this, everyone has a job to do and they don't get to jump off for a moment.\" \n Me: \"I can't say whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for you.  But here, no one stops working, we aren't permitted to sit and do nothing.  We always have to be moving no matter what.  I'm sorry I accidentally made you wait for a couple seconds and confused you by not being at my till, but there are people over there who are always working even when you can't see us.  Just because we don't have a customer doesn't mean we can stop.\" \n He went quiet and the wife paid and smiled at me as she went.  The next customer in line exploded at me: \n Lady: \"I can't believe he just said that to you!  How dare he imply his work is better than yours just because he 'doesn't have quiet times'.  What the hell does that even mean?!\"  She was quiet vehement and I managed to finally calm her down, but it was amusing that she was more passionate about it than I was.", "Picture this: today, slow rainy Saturday, last of the tourists coming through, so there were a few bursts but not even close to how busy we were last week, when a pleasant older couple came through my till, quite happy and jokey, when this conversation took place: \n (OL is for Older Lady, OG is for Older Gent and Me is for... me...) \n > Me: Hello! Do you need bags today? \n > OL: Hello, yes please. \n > OG: [puts what is clearly his wife's handbag on the top of the till] Do you like my bag? \n > Me: [laughing, playing along] yes, of course! It's fabulous! You about to go get your nails done? \n > OG: Oh yes of course, but just a buffing this time! \n Convo carries on for a bit, pleasant banter, all a good laugh. I finish their transaction, and OG leans over and whispers \n > OG: Actually, I don't like gays or men that dress as women, I think it's disgusting. \n Wat \n > Me: Oh really? Why is that? \n > OL: Well, it isn't natural, is it? \n > OG: I mean, I love them as people, as a Christian I love them, but they choose to sin so much, it's awful. \n > OL: They're just lost souls, filled with evil spirits; they just need to accept God into their lives and stop living in such filth. \n > OG: They need to rethink their life choices. \n > Me: So when did you choose to be straight? \n Pause \n > OL: We've always known. \n > Me: Well, so have they. \n > OG: Are you Christian? \n > Me: Yes, I am. [actually a lie - lost my religion years ago though I still have faith] \n > OG: Born again? \n > Me: Nope. I was born into a church and raised as a Christian. \n > OL: Well you need to read your bible again. \n At this point I switched off, I totally shut down to the bullshit that they were preaching. They just assumed not only that I was straight, but also that I'd agree. How the fuck is this acceptable? The quoted some bible verse and I wanted to retort the bible also says 'Do not Judge' but I couldn't remember it offhand (Matthew 7:1 if anyone is interested - I will deffo be reciting this to any other bigots who use their bullshit on me). \n They left soon after because another customer came to my till. I was shaking so hard with anger I couldn't scan properly and after serving 2 more customers had to give in my key and go find something to hit out the back."]}, {"subreddit": "TalesFromTheFrontDesk", "posts": ["This happened a few weeks ago now. \n A woman checked in and immediately chewed out my colleague for not reserving a space in our car park for her.  We have 40+ rooms and a 15 space car park (with other free parking facilities nearby - it's just that our car park is teeny and it's first-come-first-serve).  So already she wasn't happy. \n She checked out the next day still grumbling about everything.  She didn't want to wait around for me to actually take her card and pay so I asked her to give written permission for me to charge her card details on file without her present.  She grudgingly signed her name and 'you can charge my card details' and left.  Good riddance. \n ONLY \n Her card got declined.  The expiry date wasn't until 2016, but the card number wasn't recognised.  I went through all the correspondence - definitely the right card number. \n I phoned up.  It went to answer machine.  Left a message.  Moved the bill to a management account on the system and waited.  Two hours later I got the phonecall back.  She was screaming down the phone at me about how dare I ring her, my machine was obviously faulty, crappy machine, crappy hotel blah blah blah. \n Then she stopped mid-sentence.  She realised that the card she'd used on the booking was actually her old Lloyds Tsb card.  Now for those who don't know, Lloyds Tsb bank split last year into Lloyds and TSB.  They split their customers into two groups between the two and everyone got new cards and details.  The old cards were (mostly) now void. \n She gave me the new details, and the nightmare was over.... \n JOKES. \n She rang 30 mins later IRATE.  She'd checked her account through the phone and I'd charged her twice.  How dare I! She demanded a full refund of everything, demanded to talk to the manager (not there yet) livid livid livid.  I took a number and told her to ring back when the manager came in. \n I was just leaving as she did ring back.  She asked to speak to me (manager picked up as he was my afternoon relief).  She said that one of the declined charges had shown up in her account before being cancelled and she'd checked it before the bank had put that it had been denied on her statement.  Picture me playing up: oh thank goodness!  I had hoped our system hadn't failed, not a technical fault, thank you for letting us know.... \n Bye, bye, bye.  Put down the phone.  I knew it was going to be fine, lady.  If you had stopped yelling for 2 seconds I would've been able to tell you that myself.   Ugh.", "So this happened last summer and I'd totally forgotten about it until just now. \n Our hotel, like many hotels, has interconnecting rooms. At the time we had a bunch of long stay guests from a local business where most of their workers were from overseas so they had to stay with us. We had about 20 men dotted around the hotel staying anywhere from 6 to 18 months. We got used to their peculiarities. \n One Russian man liked to be on a low floor on the west side of the building. He went on holiday for a month and when he returned unfortunately his normal room was occupied the day he returned. So the FDA put him in the only available room fitting his requirements. It just happened to be an interconnecting room. \n He was fine there for a couple of weeks, but then we had a tour in from Germany. The FDA allocated one man in the other room from the interconnecting door. That evening it's my shift. \n Russian man is loud, chats with his friend and has the TV full volume late into the night, we know this already. German man didn't like this behaviour and began banging on the connecting doors and screaming in German. \n Russian man doesn't like this. Calls down to the desk about the crazy German next door, could we sort it out? On the phone I can hear him begin to lay into the man in English, German and Russian through the wall. We begin to also get phone calls from surrounding rooms about a commotion on that floor. \n The Russian says to me on the phone 'please sort it out because if I sort it out I will lose my job.' \n Between this moment and when security and management got to the rooms, the German had left his room, gone around to the front door of the Russian's room and knocked on his door. The Russian opened it, thinking it was us, and got a very angry German in his face instead. Thankfully neither became physically violent but all accounts say the German man was very aggressive. \n We moved the German as he was leaving the following day and asked the Russian to possibly keep it down late at night. \n The next night again I was on shift. Another tour group comes in and this time it's a French tour group. The morning shift allocate a woman travelling alone in the interconnecting room with the Russian. Which, by the way, is against our policies but that's another issue alone. \n Russian guy doesn't realise we moved German last night, nor does her know there's a new tour in. He just knows we dealt with the problem last night and now he can hear someone moving around in the room next to him. Assuming it's the German man, he decides to have some fun. \n He waits until about 9pm and then cherry knocks the woman's external door. She goes to see who it is, but no one is there. About 15mins later he does the same again. She phones down saying someone is knocking on her door and running away. This escalates until Russian is pounding on her door, and she's getting quite upset by it. We don't have CCTV in the corridors, and Russian obviously isn't doing it while we are there watching for the culprit. Then, finally, while we're sorting out her room move, Russian slips up. He pounds on the internal door. \n The game is up, he's the only one who could have done that, no one has access to his room. So management go around to talk to him. They realise he thought that the German was still in the other room, and his face fell when he was told he had been terrifying an elderly woman for no reason. \n They let him off with a warning, on the understanding that the next noise complaint we had about him we would go straight to his bosses that we could no longer accommodate him. He moved rooms the next day to a normal room and true to his word, we never had another noise complaint about him in the next 4 months he was there.", "So here's a three for the price of one. These are the Tale of the Pushy Bride, The Guilt-Trip Conlady and The Normal Rate. \n I don't know if I've established this before, but the Old Hotel is a seafront hotel. About a third of our rooms are sea-front (and I'm talking, there's a road and then the sea sort of sea front - my desk faces west over the sea and the sunsets are glorious) but because the hotel is a bit worn out, all the rooms are the same price regardless. Now this means for some of the front rooms we are seriously underselling their potential, while some of the back rooms we're definitely taking well over what they're worth, but I digress. \n The first Tale is of The Pushy Bride. These people are with the largest wedding of this year (we have a wedding at our hotel every weekend from mid-june through to the end of September) and the only one where they've literally booked every room out for their guests. When they approached the owners to hold their reception there, the owners had only just taken over the hotel, and as a result guaranteed the rooms at a much lower price than what they were worth. All of them. In August. \n I've heard of this woman from the grapevine because even though they want the best of everything from the hotel for their guests, they are notorious for haggling down the price - or at least attempting to. For example they wanted us to provide top-label champange for every table on their wedding at 75% of the price we get it from our suppliers at. They have nearly 100 guests so not only would it have been a loss on our part, the actual figure of the 'discount' they asked for is mind-boggling. So I took the stories with a pinch of salt. \n Then I got her phonecall. \n So explains her friend wants to come but 'she can't afford much, what is our best rate?' Now, people who've read my other stories know that this is my least favourite phrase. I grit my teeth and say that 'I've offered another of her guests a single room for \u00a350 BB (the best man no less).' 'But is that your best rate?' Yes, any less and we'd actually be making a loss.' 'But we're making you a profit by booking out the whole hotel at once.' 'Actually (and I still can't believe I said this to her) we're technically making a loss because every single room you are occupying (the whole hotel) is on a tariff which is approximately a third less than what we'd get on any other night just from regular bookings.' 'yes but we've booked every room for 2 nights.' 'Ma'am we've been at 90% capacity minimum for the past month and are at that point and higher for the next two already. The hotel being full is the norm here.' Pause 'there's no way you'll go cheaper?' 'only if your friend doesn't want breakfast.' \n The Tale of the Guilt-Trip Conlady \n She rang 'I want to book a room for 2 weeks time sea view please' \n > me: okay I have that room type available, it'll be \u00a3 full price. \n > her: your website says it's \u00a3 price we reserve for late bookings on midweek days we're quieter. \n > me (I'm the person who controls these prices - I know what it says for that date which is a weekend so I know she's conning me or not reading it right): well, that's incorrect, I'm going to just check that.  i google our webpage and go through the booking system to get to the page which displays our rates  well, for me it's saying \u00a3 full price  for that date. \n > her: mine says \u00a3 discounted rate .  she then goes through the steps she took to get that rate - which is exactly what I've just done on my screen. There's a bit of back and forth about this and I'm getting more amused by her, I even suggest she books via the website to see if the rate accepts and comes through to me \n >me: well, if it's displaying a different rate for you then that's a very serious matter, so I'll have to go speak to my tech dept about this. Thank you for notifying me of this issue and as you've gone out of your way to bring it to my attention I will offer you a disccounted rate. I can't honour the one you see as it's a midweek rate, but I can offer our standard quiet weekend rate of \u00a3 much less disccounted rate  if that's acceptable. \n She seems flustered by this, and I carry on with the booking as normal. As I bid her farewell I reassure her I'm going to get hold of tech and get somebody to 'fix the issue' and I'm sorry for the hassle caused etc etc laying it on thick. \n 5 mins later she rings back and tells me the website is suddenly working and she 'clicked the button harder' and it now is displaying the full price which she doesn't mind paying, so I don't have to involve the tech dept and go to that trouble... No no no, I say, in definitely giving her a discounted rate now purely because she's again gone out her way to ensure we knew the issue was fixed. Then I say bye, put down the phone and laugh my ass off at 'I clicked the button harder and it worked'. \n Tale of My Normal Rate \n The owners have another hotel on the other side of town which isn't on the seafront but it is the largest 'new' hotel in town (most of the others - like mine - are a century or more. This one was built 1980s or so maybe) so it gets a lot of business still. So we're sister hotels. Recenthy, their regulars have found we are owned by the same people and decided to come to us. Most of the time their prices match ours closely enough that we can offer the same price with minimal loss (most of the time within \u00a35 of our prices). \n When they phone us and say 'we're a regular of  sister hotel ' we ask what their typical rate is, and if it's possible we match it, if it's not we do offer discounts similarly. This woman phoned, gave me this spiel and when I asked what her normal rate was she said 'well actually I was looking for your best price'. So, we've covered that I detest the phrase 'best price' right? I gave her the full price. \n 'Are there no discounts?' 'well, if you stay for 3 or more nights it reduces to \u00a3 3 night special price ' 'and that's still your best price?' This conversation went on for ages and literally every time she spoke she used the phrase 'best offer' 'best price' or 'the best you can do'. \n Eventually she said 'well, if there's no way you can lower that I guess I'll just go back to  sister hotel  then.' The irony is, if she had just given me the figure she normally pays for  sister hotel  then I more than likely could've matched it.", "Yesterday morning was FUCKED.  Not only was it Friday, where we have an almost total hotel change over from business people to week-enders, we were full the night before and we were due to be full that night too.  I was the only fully trained FOH on the desk (we should have 3 on a Friday morning, just to put it in perspective), and the new FOH Manager was around - who's been there 2 days and doesn't know the system we use.  On top of all this, Head Office thought it was the PERFECT time to do a total-site server changeover and maintenance.  As a result for the entire shift one half of my system was totally down, and the other was slow as shit.  On top of this, because there was a rolling changeover throughout the other depts except mine (which was going to happen late at night) I had other people from dept head down to the desk to use our computers to do their work, meaning I had more people to dodge around as I did my job.  So stressful doesn't cover it. \n In all of this, I had two occasions where I almost blew my top with fury. \n First, we had a gent from Social Services in last night.  We get them on occasion.  The people turn up with some random who's been displaced from his house, or someone who needs a bed for the night but isn't bad enough for hospital or whatever.  They pay in cash, no breakfast or anything.  He was in the lobby when I got on the desk at 6.30am. When he saw me in uniform he approached.  He seemed confused about where he was, and just gave a vibe that made my hair stand up.  He asked me what his room number was. \n > Me:  doing normal name checks etc on 'puter  You're in 328, sir. \n > Creep: Where is that? \n > Me: The third floor, sir. \n > Creep: How do I get there? \n > Me:  Points to the lift literally a foot to my right   Through that, press 3. \n > Creep: Can you show me? \n > Me: I'll just get my colleague, I can't leave the desk. \n I grabbed the night manager who is a big, burly Welsh man who doesn't take shit from  anyone  and said that I was getting a weird vibe, would he mind walking bloke to his room please?  As they stepped into the lift, the gent gave me this plaintive once-over look.  Shudder. \n About three hours later, he was back at my desk.  By this point the Night Manager had left but thankfully the FOH Manager is 6 foot and change.  Creep approached my desk. \n > Creep: I'm in room 328.  Would you mind showing me where my room is. \n > Me: It's on the third floor, sir.  I can get my colleague to take you up. \n > Creep: No, that's okay, you can show me. \n Manager notices I've taken a physical step back from the desk and intervenes. \n > FOH: Can I help? \n > Me: The guest has forgotten where 328 is, could you show him? \n > Creep: No, you were helping me, I want you to show me. \n > FOH: Sorry, sir.  NejKidd can't leave the desk.  I'd be happy to take you there, or if not, it's on the third floor. \n The guy left with FOH and a sour look on his face.  An hour later he called for a taxi and left.  Thank god. \n Our check-in time is 2pm.  Apparently though, we never actually pay attention to this.  People approach the desk and if we have a room, we'll check you in.  At 10am I had 2 separate people come to the desk and ask if checking-in was possible.  As we were full, no.  Not a single room was clean in the entire place.  Nothing on my system whatsoever. \n They happily sat in the foyer on our comfy sofas just chilling out when a third person approached the desk.  Again I went through the 'I don't have any rooms and you're 4 hours early.' \n > Mr Important: But I phoned ahead and they said it'd be fine to check in this early. \n Now, our policy is to never promise ANYTHING via phone.  Not even a room allocation.  So I'm suspicious.  I notice he's booked with [third party]. \n > Me: Who did you phone? \n > Mr Important: [Third party] \n > Me: Ah, well, [third party] isn't actually associated with our on-site policies, so they wouldn't have been able to promise anything. \n > Mr Important: I've done this before here, I don't know why you're making it so difficult. \n > Me: We do try to check people in early where we have availability, sir.  Just we were full last night and at this moment I physically don't have any clean rooms. \n > Mr Important: When will you have clean rooms? \n > Me: I'm not sure sir, you're welcome to take a seat and keep checking in with me if anything has become available. \n > Mr Important: That's not acceptable.  I phoned ahead and arranged an early check-in because I have a wedding to go to at 2pm.  I need the room now. \n At this point my Duty Manager strolled past the desk, I called her over and outlined Mr Important's demands, putting emphasis on the fact that [third party] was the one to promise the man an early check-in.  She rang the HK manager, who found a cleaned room that hadn't been checked/put on the system yet within 10 minutes.  Mr Important didn't even thank me or the DM.  Just got this smug look on his face of  'See, I do get my own way.' \n The two people who had been patiently waiting then approached my desk. \n > Guest 1: Did he just check in before us while we've been waiting? \n > Me: Yes, sorry.  He phoned ahead to arrange an early check-in. \n > Guest 2: No, I overheard the conversation.  He was being a knob.  Are there any other clean rooms in your system? \n > Me: I'll just check for you. \n I didn't have clean rooms at that moment, but I was able to put guest 2 in a gorgeous sea-view room for saying out loud what I couldn't.", "Okay lovely Hospitality Victims, I have 2 stories for you today, each on the spectrum of sad and happy. \n I shall begin with the sad, which is shorter. \n A gent I shall call Mr Unlucky checked in last night at around 9pm.  He'd already phoned me earlier in the night to ask if it was okay that he was checking in after the time he'd put on his reservation by about 3 hours.  Only he'd gotten stuck in a bit of traffic.  Told him not to worry, we had a 24hr reception and for him to take it easy and take care on the wintery roads.  We'd sort everything else out for him. \n On check in, Mr Unlucky has 2 little girls, a toddler and one under 5, with him.  They were obviously in that sort of mode where they were so tired they didn't know whether they wanted to be hyper or just drop where they were on the marble floor and kip.  They were also being dazzled by the extraordinarily loud music coming from the restaurant where a Christmas party was taking place and all the gorgeous but drunk people meandering through the lobby. \n Mr Unlucky explains they've come from Kent.  Normally this would've been a 4 hours journey, tops.  But because someone flipped their car (and just before Christmas, shame) there was a 3 hour tailback.  We had 2 adults and 1 child in the room.  Mr Unlucky says, no it originally was for 2 adults and 2 children, but his wife had fallen at work on the Friday and severely hurt her back, she was laid up at home.  I note that the reservation is for a week, so this implies Mrs Unlucky will be home alone and in pain for Christmas.  Ouch. \n Lastly, I ask where he's parked.  He says by the back door.  Oh.  In the courtyard, sir?  Yes, thankfully his luck had changed and he'd found a parking space right at the entrance. \n > Me: Oh.  I'm very sorry, sir.  Those are permit only parking spaces.  If you leave it there you'll be ticketed. \n > Mr Unlucky: You're joking.  Where am I supposed to park? \n > Me: There's a car park right next door to us. \n > Mr Unlucky: Yeah, I tried there, but it's full. \n > Me  realising that it's a Saturday, we've got this do on here and the Bingo hall next door  Yeah, it would be this time of night.  I'll find you a map to move your car. \n > Mr Unlucky: So after checking in, I've got to leave my two girls in the room alone to move my car to further away from the hotel and walk the distance back. \n At this point the younger girl has made up her mind to sniffle, the one that precedes a proper cry. \n > Me: I'm so sorry, sir.  I really wish there was something more I could do. \n > My Unlucky: How much will the fine be? \n > Me: About \u00a340 \n > Mr Unlucky: Fuck it.  I'm done with today.  They can fine me. \n > Me: Well, okay.  Hope you have a good sleep. \n > Mr Unlucky:  picking up his now-sobbing child and somehow balancing her on top of a pile of pillows, toys and coats   So do I! \n The worst thing about all this was that we can issue permits, only in very specific occasions and only at the behest of a manager.  However, because it was so busy, I couldn't guarantee being able to find one before the two little ones got beyond tired.  I did have a word when one of them did surface from the roiling crowd of people, but I don't know what decision they made to issue the permit or not. \n But the second story is much more light hearted. \n As I mentioned above, there were LOTS of drunk people around.  When I left the hotel, I went through the front entrance.  Also, when I finish a shift I change into plain clothes because I hate wearing my uniform unnecessarily.  I also wrap up like a snowman with a cold.  Fluffy bobble hat, super long scarf wrapped around my face for extra warms, gloves, trench coat and undercoat.  Then I have these huge, geek-ish glasses because I hate not being able to see things properly, which are quite recognisable. \n As I left, this woman saw me, and looked at me as if she hadn't seen me in years.  Now, I have just moved back to the area I grew up in from when I was really little, but I left here when I was 8.  It wasn't likely I'd see anyone I knew, or who would recognise me, but it isn't a slim possibility.  Then she slurred out her next words. \n > Mrs Drunk:  Oh my god you're our receptionist! \n Oh.  So she hadn't recognised me from years ago.  She was just sloshed enough that she was amazed I wasn't in my normal formal uniform.  Thank god? \n She gave me a massive hug, then turned and yelled across the (already noisy) lobby. \n > DAVE! Oi! Dave!  Git ova 'ere!  Look! It's our receptionist! \n Dave stumbles up to me.  Great, he's hammered too.  He shook my hand, gave me a big, sloppy kiss on the back of my (thankfully gloved) hand, and then said: \n >  You're wonderful, you are.  I'm gonna tell them you're good on the review thingy.  And you're new.  Congratulations! \n Dave then shakes my hand quite forcefully up and down. \n I ask him if he knows my name, he confirms and with great difficulty, mumbles it out, crossing his eyebrows with the concentration.  My name isn't difficult, and you've probably met two or three people with my name, but it definitely isn't common.  But it might as well have been in a totally foreign language with how he pronounced it.  Oh well.  Close enough. \n >  Mrs Drunk: 'Ere.  You made our night, you 'ave.  You checked us in!  You were great.  An' you're new an' all.  You did a great job, didn't she do a great job, Dave? \n Dave nods his assent and I ask them how their night is etc.  This is all going on about 6 feet from the front desk and my colleagues are standing there watching with growing curiosity from when the woman hugged me, then the bloke shook my hand twice, and then the woman hugs me again on goodbye, only because of the noise they can't hear anything of what we're saying. \n Finally I break free and approach the desk.  One of the others ask who those people are. \n > Me:  I have absolutely no idea.  Apparently I checked them in and made their night.  I don't even remember who they are! \n We had a good laugh about it and I head out the door. \n Today I was lucky enough to catch them checking out. \n > Me: How was your evening? \n > Them: Oh god.  We don't remember much. \n > Me: Oh really?  Do you remember talking to me? \n Dave puts his hand on his face and Mrs Drunk's face drains of colour.  But I'm grinning at them. \n > Mrs Drunk: What did we do? \n > Me: Don't worry.  You gave me a hug and told me how wonderful I am, of course.   I fluffed my hair dramatically \n They began laughing and we just had a nice chat.  I wished them on their way and I wonder if they will actually mention me on those reviews..."]}]}

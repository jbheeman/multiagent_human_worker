Go to the source referenced by the hello world program.\n5. From the referenced source, read what the components of the program do to understand that each period needs a backtick after the initial `r.\n6. Observe that in the given code, there are 12 periods but only 11 backticks after the initial `r, so the missing character is a backtick.", "Number of steps": "6", "How long did this take?": "15 minutes", "Tools": "1.

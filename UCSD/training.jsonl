I had used several GoMay products about a two years ago. I have liked them all, and there are some products that I have repurchased (love their aminos face wash). I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container. I am copying over my old review as the info is all the same, and my experience is the same. While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container. Has a press down lid that pops out some product. Keeps it clean and safe! BUT if you want to get into the container, the lid does come off.<br /><br />--Minimal scent- naturally occurring. Can't quite put my finger on the aroma. It dissipates quickly, and it is really faint. Like green tea and plain yogurt.<br /><br />--The cream absorbs quickly. It just soaks right into my skin. I have skin that leans dry, and I do follow up with either a hydrating sunscreen, or if used at night I add a thicker emollient. Your experience may vary.<br /><br />3% active retinol-- age eraser, give it time (at least 3-4 \u00a0months of consistent use)<br />2% hyaluronic acid-- excellent humectant<br />Vitamin C, Vitamin E--antioxidants, skin brightener<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Here is the full list of ingredients:<br /><br />-AQUA \u00a0water!<br /><br />-BUTYLENE GLYCOL (1) skin-conditioning agent - miscellaneous, solvent, viscosity decreasing agent, humectant, masking, skin conditioning, and viscosity controlling.

The band (although rubber type as well) has a great ribbed look which makes it look different and fashionable. I got it in white and it looks great with the red face of my iwatch. I am finally wearing my watch again. This is a great band and recommend to everyone!", "review_title": "One of my absolute favorites", "product": {"title": "STEEZRD Ocean Sport Silicone Bands Compatible with Apple Watch Band 49mm 45mm 44mm 42mm 41mm 40mm 38mm, Soft Breathable Classic Clasp Wrist Strap for iWatch Ultra Series 8/SE/7/6/5/4/3/2/1 Men Women", "brand": null, "price": 4.98, "main_category": "AMAZON FASHION"}}}

They returned to more normal levels after a few hours.<br /><br />In fact, I liked this device so well, I purchased another, to keep track of the air quality upstairs as well as downstairs in my home.  At first, I had difficulty getting the second device recognized by the app and connected to my home network.  However, it IS possible to have two wifi devices displayed in the app.  Once the devices are set up, they display separate real time readings, and keep independent data histories.  (See my photos--one of them has been enhanced a little to make the figures and the device names \u201cAir Quality\u201d and \u201cAir Quality 2\u201d easier to read.)<br /><br />CONNECTION TIPS:  The key things to know about the wifi setup are as follows: (1) your phone or tablet (with the app) has to be connected to a 2.4Ghz network; (2) the Temtop monitoring device has to be reset with a paperclip so that you see an \u201cascending\u201d wireless signal (not just a blinking wireless signal), when you\u2019re joining the home network; and (3) any other Temtop monitoring device already connected to the network should be turned off when you\u2019re connecting the new device.<br /><br />I\u2019m not positive that step 3 is required, but my second device would NOT connect to my network until I turned the first device off.  After you get the Temtop devices connected, you can reconnect your phone or tablet to a faster 5Ghz band, and the Temtop app will still work.<br /><br />AIR QUALITY HISTORY TIPS:  First, the air quality history comes up in the app when you tap the area that shows the real time readings.  Second, if you try to bring up the history and you see \u201cno data\u201d, you may have to (1) turn the device off and on again, and/or (2) log out of the app and log back in again.<br /><br />Clearly, it would be nice if the app were less \u201cuppity\u201d, but the air quality monitors seem to be quite responsive to changes.  My upstairs monitor shows consistently higher TVOC readings, for example, because the upstairs has more shampoo, Lysol sprays, etc. in regular use.  Once an aerosol spray gets into the air, it will take several hours for it to clear.<br /><br />Also, it would be nice if the app could be set to show local temperatures in Fahrenheit rather than Centigrade.

However, I\u2019m happy with them so far--especially with the real time and historical data available through the app.  You can use the app to set your device to record data at certain intervals--starting at as often as every 10 minutes.<br /><br />I do have to keep the devices plugged in all the time, because the battery drains so quickly.

All of the calipers with which I have worked have been strictly mechanical, so this is my first experience with a digital caliper (and also the WEN brand of tools). So far, my experience has been very positive and I am pleased with it.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it is accurate, it feels solid, it comes in a very good storage case and it\u2019s easy to read.<br /><br />First things first. I have received other measuring devices that have been inaccurate in measure because the scale was completely off. If an inch isn\u2019t really an inch, a measuring tool is completely useless. I compared this tool to one known to be accurate and was able to determine that the scale is correct, so this tool\u2019s measurements can be trusted for both metric and imperial measures. Comparing the digital readout to the analog, the two numbers match. This might seem like it should be obvious, but I have been stung on these types of things in the past so it\u2019s good to see a device that has been properly designed and calibrated right out of the box.<br /><br />The mechanical part of the caliper works exactly as expected, so I am not going to go into that; the digital part is much more interesting.<br /><br />The digital readout is very clear and easy to understand. The default setting is millimeters with precision to 0.01 mm. It can be changed to decimal or fractional inches at the touch of a button. There is another button that sets the measurement to 0, from which further measurement is offset (it\u2019s similar to setting a tare weight on a scale). What I especially find interesting is that the settings are preserved when the unit is turned off and back on again.<br /><br />The digital assembly of this caliper is fairly compact, relying on a CR2032 button battery. This is a smart design choice as two AAA batteries would have drastically increased the size and the weight.<br /><br />There are a couple of thoughtful design choices that have gone into this caliper as well. There is a thumb wheel that allows for very simple and easy one-handed operation. A small knob that can be tightened adds a bit of drag when making adjustments too, so it is easy to get very precise without having to readjust over and over. On the back of the caliper there is a printed table that shows measures in inches converted from fractional to decimal equivalents. This table ranges from 1/64\u201d to 1\u201d. The only complaint I have with this caliper is actually this table \u2013 the print is so small it\u2019s hard on the eyes.<br /><br />The caliper comes in a hard plastic case with a foam padded interior, with a cut-out where the caliper fits. The case closes nicely and should not pop open in transit unless it\u2019s abused, and it provides very good protection for the caliper.<br /><br />Before I worked with this caliper I was unfamiliar with the brand and I was unfamiliar with digital calipers. It has proven to be a very good tool that is accurate, it has some good design features and comes in a good carrying case. It isn\u2019t priced outrageously, either.

I had not heard of RockJam before and based on the price I thought this would be a low-end guitar suitable for someone just learning or still toying with the idea of learning to play. This proved to be right. This is not the guitar that an experienced player would want or use but it is a great starting point. The cost alone makes this worth consideration.<br /><br />This is a basic set-up, in every sense of the word. The guitar itself is lightweight and is made from base-level components, and as such it is not going to have the richness of sound of a higher-end instrument. For the cost, it is better than I expected, but this is relative - this is still a bare-bones configuration.<br /><br />It comes with everything you need to start learning and hitting chords - the guitar itself, a cheap plastic stand, an extra set of strings, a small set of plastic picks, and an electronic tuner. There\u2019s also a nylon carry bag for everything. The bag is of little or no protection at all and will not protect the guitar from anything more than getting dirty.<br /><br />Looking over the guitar I was surprised to find that there weren\u2019t too many obvious flaws. The veneer and varnish seem to be smooth and I found no peeling or bubbles, the inlay is smooth with no gaps, and the stock feels sturdy. One of the frets is slightly jagged on one end and probably not bad enough to nick the skin, but it is enough to feel it when I glide my hand over it. Careful work with a small file can alleviate this if yours has the same issue.<br /><br />While it might appear to be made well at a glance, everything about this guitar suggests it was manufactured for economy more than quality. The instrument is particularly light, the exceptionally lightweight bag, the plastic stand and the one jagged fret all point to a lower-end vision for this instrument.<br /><br />The cost of this instrument counterbalances the quality, though. For under $100 this is actually a decent instrument, ideal for someone who still is unsure of whether or not they want to play guitar or if they\u2019re just starting out and wanting to learn the basics. Someone who has been playing for a while will likely be less than impressed, while someone who started with this guitar is very likely to move on to a better instrument eventually.<br /><br />For the cost, this is a fine option if you\u2019re wanting a bare-bones configuration for learning or piquing interest.

They fit snugly but not tight so I can tilt my head down and not have them slip off and they do not pinch my ears. After a little while I do need to take them off, though, as they do start to get a little uncomfortable. The pads are reasonably soft and there is even a replacement set of pads in the box - a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Also included in the box are two audio cables and a 1/4\" converter.<br /><br />The sound profile is spot-on.

When the price dropped to $1997 on Amazon, I snapped it up. For the money, it is the best 4K TV out there. The smart controls work great, allowing you to use apps or browse the Internet on the TV, including side-by-side while you are watching TV. There's only a little 4k stuff out, mostly on Netflix - oceans, desserts, underwater world, etc. They are fantastic! Eventually, there will be more 4k. Haven't tried HDR yet. But, one of the reasons I got the TV was because it was one of ones that had HDR.<br /><br />I used rtings' (http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/js8500/settings) calibration settings to sharpen the picture. Rtings really likes this TV: http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/best. It is their second best after the much pricier LG OLED. This review influenced my purchase.<br /><br />One of the main reason I got this TV was to watch movies. It is pretty much theater quality if you can sit within about 8 1/2 feet of the screen. You start to get the immersion effect when you are a little less the 9 feet away. The picture is still excellent from 10 feet, but you don't quite get the immersion effect. When the shots in the movie are bright, sunny and colorful, the view is spectacular - wow! When the shots are dark you see much more detail than I saw on my previous TV, which was a 2010 47&#34; 1080p LG. It was a good TV that I had professionally calibrated. But, it was no where near the quality of this TV: a 5-6 vs this one that's a 9-10.<br /><br />I thought about the Samsung JS9000, which is $1,000 more - pretty much just for the curved screen. Didn't think it was worth it. The LG OLED 65&#34; is better. Pretty much every review says so. But, it's priced at $4k, which is more than I wanted to spend.<br /><br />For sports, everything is really good. No judder that I've noticed. Daytime watching is plenty bright enough.

It does need some painting to look realistic, since it is all molded in a single color (white) or actually two if you count the clear window glass material.  I used red paint for window frames and 4 of the gas pumps, white for two of the other pumps, silver for rain downspouts and vent on the roof and aged concrete for the pump islands.  Instruction sheet is easy to follow with parts numbered.  I have not quite finished building yet, as one thing is holding me up.  In the pictures on the box, it shows several thin black lines on the trim and I don't know how to get those put on without it oozing over into the white.  Even a very thin brush might not work; maybe a toothpick?  The kit comes with decals and I AWAYS have trouble with decals and usually end up destroying some of them.  What I do as a precaution is to make a couple color photocopies of the decals and then I can always cut out the pieces and glue them on in lieu of the decals. If you really want to do your decals well, you also need to buy a bottle of Micro Sol, which softens the decal and makes them adhere better. (I have it, use it and it works well.)  The kit comes with 3 different sets of 6 gas pumps, so you can use the pumps that fit the era you are modeling.  Unfortunately there are only two pump islands, so you can't swap pumps if you want to change the era, even though you have the pumps for the 3 eras.  (Too bad the kit didn't include three sets of pump islands.)  The only other thing that defines the era is the standing sign; two signs included; one to accommodate Standard oil and the other to accommodate either \"Al's Victory Service\" or \"Jerry's Gas and Garage\" on the sign.  The only thing that I really did not like about this kit is that the gas pumps seem to lack detail.  They don't look like they have any dispenser hoses on them; that can make a big difference in realism.  The decals are a bit \"congested\" on the decal sheet, so be careful.  Also be careful with the plastic sprues that the parts are attached to.  There are a few very tiny parts that can come loose; I almost lost the air pump when it fell off.  This is a decent gas station kit and probably a good kit for a beginner, but I do think there are better looking gas station kits out there.  Generally the Walthers kits are nice, but need a lot of painting to look realistic.  This kit needs less painting than some other kits.  Note: there are quite a few small pieces, so you need patience.  Also this kit and all the garage and gas station kits I have bought and assembled do not come with a base or concrete driveways, so you have to create your own; I used heavy card stock and gray spray paint.

It drives me nuts to waste my time, $, & energy to purchase something, wait on it to arrive, then go through the hassle of the returns to then wait for a replacement only to have the replacement be just as defective or often worse than the original. Apparently the entire tim of these stamps was bad & nobody ever bothered to fix it.

The pigeon is flawed too, but works. Idk if their designer messed up or their manufacturer did, but the actual bird designs are not true to life on several either which I find to be most annoying as a bird lover.  It would make an ok gift for kids if you can find them on sale & know 1/4 are useless imo.  I have no idea why they bothered to put the bird names on the stamps bc you cannot read them.  Great in theory, but lousy execution. I would definitely buy them again if they fixed the flaws & I am actually hoping that Amazon will replace them as these are flawed & I am just stupid enough, foolish enough, naive enough, or hopeful enough that the replacement will arrive perfect.

Bottom line:  some birds good, some birds very bad, do yourself a favor & cut the names of the birds off the stamps if you choose to buy them & keep them. It\u2019s just a little minor surgery between friends & nobody gets hurt.  Besides:  doesn\u2019t everyone feel like wielding a sharp instrument every now & then?

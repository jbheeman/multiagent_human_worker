I had used several GoMay products about a two years ago. I have liked them all, and there are some products that I have repurchased (love their aminos face wash). I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container. I am copying over my old review as the info is all the same, and my experience is the same. While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container. Has a press down lid that pops out some product. Keeps it clean and safe! BUT if you want to get into the container, the lid does come off.<br /><br />--Minimal scent- naturally occurring. Can't quite put my finger on the aroma. It dissipates quickly, and it is really faint. Like green tea and plain yogurt.<br /><br />--The cream absorbs quickly. It just soaks right into my skin. I have skin that leans dry, and I do follow up with either a hydrating sunscreen, or if used at night I add a thicker emollient. Your experience may vary.<br /><br />3% active retinol-- age eraser, give it time (at least 3-4 \u00a0months of consistent use)<br />2% hyaluronic acid-- excellent humectant<br />Vitamin C, Vitamin E--antioxidants, skin brightener<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Here is the full list of ingredients:<br /><br />-AQUA \u00a0water!<br /><br />-BUTYLENE GLYCOL (1) skin-conditioning agent - miscellaneous, solvent, viscosity decreasing agent, humectant, masking, skin conditioning, and viscosity controlling.

The band (although rubber type as well) has a great ribbed look which makes it look different and fashionable. I got it in white and it looks great with the red face of my iwatch. I am finally wearing my watch again. This is a great band and recommend to everyone!", "review_title": "One of my absolute favorites", "product": {"title": "STEEZRD Ocean Sport Silicone Bands Compatible with Apple Watch Band 49mm 45mm 44mm 42mm 41mm 40mm 38mm, Soft Breathable Classic Clasp Wrist Strap for iWatch Ultra Series 8/SE/7/6/5/4/3/2/1 Men Women", "brand": null, "price": 4.98, "main_category": "AMAZON FASHION"}}}

They returned to more normal levels after a few hours.<br /><br />In fact, I liked this device so well, I purchased another, to keep track of the air quality upstairs as well as downstairs in my home.  At first, I had difficulty getting the second device recognized by the app and connected to my home network.  However, it IS possible to have two wifi devices displayed in the app.  Once the devices are set up, they display separate real time readings, and keep independent data histories.  (See my photos--one of them has been enhanced a little to make the figures and the device names \u201cAir Quality\u201d and \u201cAir Quality 2\u201d easier to read.)<br /><br />CONNECTION TIPS:  The key things to know about the wifi setup are as follows: (1) your phone or tablet (with the app) has to be connected to a 2.4Ghz network; (2) the Temtop monitoring device has to be reset with a paperclip so that you see an \u201cascending\u201d wireless signal (not just a blinking wireless signal), when you\u2019re joining the home network; and (3) any other Temtop monitoring device already connected to the network should be turned off when you\u2019re connecting the new device.<br /><br />I\u2019m not positive that step 3 is required, but my second device would NOT connect to my network until I turned the first device off.  After you get the Temtop devices connected, you can reconnect your phone or tablet to a faster 5Ghz band, and the Temtop app will still work.<br /><br />AIR QUALITY HISTORY TIPS:  First, the air quality history comes up in the app when you tap the area that shows the real time readings.  Second, if you try to bring up the history and you see \u201cno data\u201d, you may have to (1) turn the device off and on again, and/or (2) log out of the app and log back in again.<br /><br />Clearly, it would be nice if the app were less \u201cuppity\u201d, but the air quality monitors seem to be quite responsive to changes.  My upstairs monitor shows consistently higher TVOC readings, for example, because the upstairs has more shampoo, Lysol sprays, etc. in regular use.  Once an aerosol spray gets into the air, it will take several hours for it to clear.<br /><br />Also, it would be nice if the app could be set to show local temperatures in Fahrenheit rather than Centigrade.

However, I\u2019m happy with them so far--especially with the real time and historical data available through the app.  You can use the app to set your device to record data at certain intervals--starting at as often as every 10 minutes.<br /><br />I do have to keep the devices plugged in all the time, because the battery drains so quickly.

All of the calipers with which I have worked have been strictly mechanical, so this is my first experience with a digital caliper (and also the WEN brand of tools). So far, my experience has been very positive and I am pleased with it.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it is accurate, it feels solid, it comes in a very good storage case and it\u2019s easy to read.<br /><br />First things first. I have received other measuring devices that have been inaccurate in measure because the scale was completely off. If an inch isn\u2019t really an inch, a measuring tool is completely useless. I compared this tool to one known to be accurate and was able to determine that the scale is correct, so this tool\u2019s measurements can be trusted for both metric and imperial measures. Comparing the digital readout to the analog, the two numbers match. This might seem like it should be obvious, but I have been stung on these types of things in the past so it\u2019s good to see a device that has been properly designed and calibrated right out of the box.<br /><br />The mechanical part of the caliper works exactly as expected, so I am not going to go into that; the digital part is much more interesting.<br /><br />The digital readout is very clear and easy to understand. The default setting is millimeters with precision to 0.01 mm. It can be changed to decimal or fractional inches at the touch of a button. There is another button that sets the measurement to 0, from which further measurement is offset (it\u2019s similar to setting a tare weight on a scale). What I especially find interesting is that the settings are preserved when the unit is turned off and back on again.<br /><br />The digital assembly of this caliper is fairly compact, relying on a CR2032 button battery. This is a smart design choice as two AAA batteries would have drastically increased the size and the weight.<br /><br />There are a couple of thoughtful design choices that have gone into this caliper as well. There is a thumb wheel that allows for very simple and easy one-handed operation. A small knob that can be tightened adds a bit of drag when making adjustments too, so it is easy to get very precise without having to readjust over and over. On the back of the caliper there is a printed table that shows measures in inches converted from fractional to decimal equivalents. This table ranges from 1/64\u201d to 1\u201d. The only complaint I have with this caliper is actually this table \u2013 the print is so small it\u2019s hard on the eyes.<br /><br />The caliper comes in a hard plastic case with a foam padded interior, with a cut-out where the caliper fits. The case closes nicely and should not pop open in transit unless it\u2019s abused, and it provides very good protection for the caliper.<br /><br />Before I worked with this caliper I was unfamiliar with the brand and I was unfamiliar with digital calipers. It has proven to be a very good tool that is accurate, it has some good design features and comes in a good carrying case. It isn\u2019t priced outrageously, either.

I had not heard of RockJam before and based on the price I thought this would be a low-end guitar suitable for someone just learning or still toying with the idea of learning to play. This proved to be right. This is not the guitar that an experienced player would want or use but it is a great starting point. The cost alone makes this worth consideration.<br /><br />This is a basic set-up, in every sense of the word. The guitar itself is lightweight and is made from base-level components, and as such it is not going to have the richness of sound of a higher-end instrument. For the cost, it is better than I expected, but this is relative - this is still a bare-bones configuration.<br /><br />It comes with everything you need to start learning and hitting chords - the guitar itself, a cheap plastic stand, an extra set of strings, a small set of plastic picks, and an electronic tuner. There\u2019s also a nylon carry bag for everything. The bag is of little or no protection at all and will not protect the guitar from anything more than getting dirty.<br /><br />Looking over the guitar I was surprised to find that there weren\u2019t too many obvious flaws. The veneer and varnish seem to be smooth and I found no peeling or bubbles, the inlay is smooth with no gaps, and the stock feels sturdy. One of the frets is slightly jagged on one end and probably not bad enough to nick the skin, but it is enough to feel it when I glide my hand over it. Careful work with a small file can alleviate this if yours has the same issue.<br /><br />While it might appear to be made well at a glance, everything about this guitar suggests it was manufactured for economy more than quality. The instrument is particularly light, the exceptionally lightweight bag, the plastic stand and the one jagged fret all point to a lower-end vision for this instrument.<br /><br />The cost of this instrument counterbalances the quality, though. For under $100 this is actually a decent instrument, ideal for someone who still is unsure of whether or not they want to play guitar or if they\u2019re just starting out and wanting to learn the basics. Someone who has been playing for a while will likely be less than impressed, while someone who started with this guitar is very likely to move on to a better instrument eventually.<br /><br />For the cost, this is a fine option if you\u2019re wanting a bare-bones configuration for learning or piquing interest.

They fit snugly but not tight so I can tilt my head down and not have them slip off and they do not pinch my ears. After a little while I do need to take them off, though, as they do start to get a little uncomfortable. The pads are reasonably soft and there is even a replacement set of pads in the box - a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Also included in the box are two audio cables and a 1/4\" converter.<br /><br />The sound profile is spot-on.

When the price dropped to $1997 on Amazon, I snapped it up. For the money, it is the best 4K TV out there. The smart controls work great, allowing you to use apps or browse the Internet on the TV, including side-by-side while you are watching TV. There's only a little 4k stuff out, mostly on Netflix - oceans, desserts, underwater world, etc. They are fantastic! Eventually, there will be more 4k. Haven't tried HDR yet. But, one of the reasons I got the TV was because it was one of ones that had HDR.<br /><br />I used rtings' (http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/js8500/settings) calibration settings to sharpen the picture. Rtings really likes this TV: http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/best. It is their second best after the much pricier LG OLED. This review influenced my purchase.<br /><br />One of the main reason I got this TV was to watch movies. It is pretty much theater quality if you can sit within about 8 1/2 feet of the screen. You start to get the immersion effect when you are a little less the 9 feet away. The picture is still excellent from 10 feet, but you don't quite get the immersion effect. When the shots in the movie are bright, sunny and colorful, the view is spectacular - wow! When the shots are dark you see much more detail than I saw on my previous TV, which was a 2010 47&#34; 1080p LG. It was a good TV that I had professionally calibrated. But, it was no where near the quality of this TV: a 5-6 vs this one that's a 9-10.<br /><br />I thought about the Samsung JS9000, which is $1,000 more - pretty much just for the curved screen. Didn't think it was worth it. The LG OLED 65&#34; is better. Pretty much every review says so. But, it's priced at $4k, which is more than I wanted to spend.<br /><br />For sports, everything is really good. No judder that I've noticed. Daytime watching is plenty bright enough.

It does need some painting to look realistic, since it is all molded in a single color (white) or actually two if you count the clear window glass material.  I used red paint for window frames and 4 of the gas pumps, white for two of the other pumps, silver for rain downspouts and vent on the roof and aged concrete for the pump islands.  Instruction sheet is easy to follow with parts numbered.  I have not quite finished building yet, as one thing is holding me up.  In the pictures on the box, it shows several thin black lines on the trim and I don't know how to get those put on without it oozing over into the white.  Even a very thin brush might not work; maybe a toothpick?  The kit comes with decals and I AWAYS have trouble with decals and usually end up destroying some of them.  What I do as a precaution is to make a couple color photocopies of the decals and then I can always cut out the pieces and glue them on in lieu of the decals. If you really want to do your decals well, you also need to buy a bottle of Micro Sol, which softens the decal and makes them adhere better. (I have it, use it and it works well.)  The kit comes with 3 different sets of 6 gas pumps, so you can use the pumps that fit the era you are modeling.  Unfortunately there are only two pump islands, so you can't swap pumps if you want to change the era, even though you have the pumps for the 3 eras.  (Too bad the kit didn't include three sets of pump islands.)  The only other thing that defines the era is the standing sign; two signs included; one to accommodate Standard oil and the other to accommodate either \"Al's Victory Service\" or \"Jerry's Gas and Garage\" on the sign.  The only thing that I really did not like about this kit is that the gas pumps seem to lack detail.  They don't look like they have any dispenser hoses on them; that can make a big difference in realism.  The decals are a bit \"congested\" on the decal sheet, so be careful.  Also be careful with the plastic sprues that the parts are attached to.  There are a few very tiny parts that can come loose; I almost lost the air pump when it fell off.  This is a decent gas station kit and probably a good kit for a beginner, but I do think there are better looking gas station kits out there.  Generally the Walthers kits are nice, but need a lot of painting to look realistic.  This kit needs less painting than some other kits.  Note: there are quite a few small pieces, so you need patience.  Also this kit and all the garage and gas station kits I have bought and assembled do not come with a base or concrete driveways, so you have to create your own; I used heavy card stock and gray spray paint.

It drives me nuts to waste my time, $, & energy to purchase something, wait on it to arrive, then go through the hassle of the returns to then wait for a replacement only to have the replacement be just as defective or often worse than the original. Apparently the entire tim of these stamps was bad & nobody ever bothered to fix it.

The pigeon is flawed too, but works. Idk if their designer messed up or their manufacturer did, but the actual bird designs are not true to life on several either which I find to be most annoying as a bird lover.  It would make an ok gift for kids if you can find them on sale & know 1/4 are useless imo.  I have no idea why they bothered to put the bird names on the stamps bc you cannot read them.  Great in theory, but lousy execution. I would definitely buy them again if they fixed the flaws & I am actually hoping that Amazon will replace them as these are flawed & I am just stupid enough, foolish enough, naive enough, or hopeful enough that the replacement will arrive perfect.

Bottom line:  some birds good, some birds very bad, do yourself a favor & cut the names of the birds off the stamps if you choose to buy them & keep them. It\u2019s just a little minor surgery between friends & nobody gets hurt.  Besides:  doesn\u2019t everyone feel like wielding a sharp instrument every now & then?

We have a very small kitchen and 4 recessed lights.  Our old LED recessed lights, approximately 10 years old, began to fail and we purchased these as replacements.  We replace all LED lights in a series (like in the kitchen) at once - even if only one is failing - as in this case.  I am VERY disappointed in these.  First, they are a fraction of the weight of the old ones - quality?  I know things 'improve' with time- sometimes getting lighter in weight, but in this case - NO.  We installed them and in the process discovered they have 4 light brightness/color settings.  The lower wattage you go, the more 'yellow' the lights become.  Now for the real kicker - and kiss of death - they strobe or flicker or phase in and out - whatever phrase you want to call it.  When on the brightest setting, every 4 seconds - on the dimmest setting every 15 seconds.  I get migraines over such flickering - so they are junk to us.  I have read other reviews complaining about these since purchasing and a lot are suggesting you MUST install a 'dimmer' switch to control the flicker!  That is not an option in our kitchen as we have dual light switches.  But even if it was, I would return them.  The old ones didn't flicker. Our house is completely LED and NONE of them flicker.  So, they are being returned flat out.  BEWARE.  If you purchase these they are probably going to flicker - if that doesn't bother you, fine.  If it does, as with most folks, do not purchase these.

I don\u2019t regret buying it. But having said that it does have some flaws. Firstly: This Pok\u00e9mon game was ALOT easier than the older Red, Blue and Yellow ones. I was able to collect all 8 badges in 10 hours of playtime, a lot of that time I wasn\u2019t even playing and just left the game on and a lot more of it was spent in the constant cut scenes. It seems like just when I feel like I\u2019m really getting going Sonia, or especially, Hop interfere and want to have long conversations or, for Hop, to duel me. It\u2019s pretty annoying. Not only that but the fights are much easier. I got through every gym and got all 8 badges without losing a single battle. I didn\u2019t even bother looking for more powerful Pok\u00e9mon because the first 6 I got were fine and able to beat anyone I came across.<br /><br />Having said that, this game is great for children! It\u2019s not too hard where they\u2019ll get frustrated, but it\u2019s not too easy for children either. Each gym battle (except one) is fought in a huge arena and it feels great to hear the crowd cheering you on. The music is upbeat and really got me in the mood to kick butt.

Obviously I prefer my PC but it\u2019s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly \u201cSwitch\u201d to the Switch and continue my game.<br /><br />There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo\u2019s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they\u2019re splattering paint all over each other.<br /><br />However the Switch also has its cons. Let\u2019s start with Nintendo\u2019s \u201cE-Shop\u201d. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.<br /><br />Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony\u2019s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.<br /><br />All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It\u2019s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it\u2019s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.<br /><br />5/5 Stars", "review_title": "It has its pros & cons..but more pros!", "product": {"title": "Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy\u2011Con", "brand": null, "price": 299.99, "main_category": "All Electronics"}}, {"parent_asin": "B09B35J159", "rating": 5.0, "timestamp_ms": 1594470230285, "review_excerpt": "I upgraded to the Razer Basilisk Ultimate from my old Razer Deathadder Elite and I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />When I ordered it I was a bit worried that it would have disconnection issues, or input lag, or other issues like that but in the week or so I have had it I haven't had any problems whatsoever.

No controller is ever perfect; I might have a few go-tos for different genres, but having a favorite means I won't have a favorite later. I've read around about this GuliKit controller. The technology checks out: Hall-effect sticks, mechanical buttons, and metal parts? Count me in! It's also in the shape of the Xbox controller, which is super comfortable.<br /><br />In the hand, this controllers feels great. It's got a soft, matte-like texture. It's not rubbery to the touch, but more of a grainy plastic. The area around the sticks are metal, but I'm unsure of the triggers. They feel plastic without me removing them. The buttons feel awesome. They're my favorite next to Nintendo's ABXY buttons. Because the buttons use a mechanical switch, there will be less wear-and-tear in the long run. They can be switched around for an Xbox-style layout, but I'm leaving mine as they came.<br /><br />The sticks are nice and snappy. They always snap into the center and feel good to move. I know they use Hall-effect switches (which also were used in keyboards long ago), and I'm aware of the technology behind it; I have no doubt they will prove better in the long run too, but I'm also curious as to what issues may be presented that haven't yet.<br /><br />There are a couple issues I have with the controller that I'll mention now. One is the positioning of the OS buttons. There's start and minus akin to the Switch, as well as menu, screen-capture, and a controller-setting buttons. I wish the menu and screen-capture buttons were swapped with the start and select buttons. I found myself several times pressing menu or screen capture when I meant to press start and select. The former buttons are placed where start and select normally are (at least for me), so I've had lots of accidental presses. I hope there's an update in the future that lets me customize any button.<br /><br />Another issue is the triggers. The back triggers have too much real estate, leaving the front triggers uncomfortable to press. I know this is completely dependent on the user's hands, but my index fingers rest on the triggers and I have to twist my hand to press the front triggers. This is a problem in games like Metroid Dread, which make heavy use of the front triggers. I know the Switch can swap buttons, but it doesn't eliminate the discomfort.<br /><br />Those are my only issues. Overall, I love this controller. The controller settings are another feature I love. Using just the settings button and other button combos, I can change the vibration intensity (thank you!), the distance of the sticks, and the distance of the back triggers, which I believe are digital with some analog distance.

For over a decade I've casually eyed this controller, seeing its price rise from high double digits to what it is now. Still, I don't think the price is that bad for such a unique controller. I love it when companies take their own, fresh perspective on standard controller layouts without making them unwieldy. Comfort is usually the driving force for change, as well as quality-of-life improvements. 8BitDo has been doing a fantastic job in this regard, and now Retro Fighters isn't far behind.<br /><br />Retro Fighters (\u201cRF\u201d) is doing wonderful things in the controller world. My first controller was the Brawler64 when it came out in different colors. (While I was aware of the Kickstarter, I avoided it out of personal reasons with Kickstarter itself.) It was love at first touch. It perfectly conformed to my hand and felt wonderful. The d-pad could use some refinement, but overall it's great. Fast-forwarding through a bunch of controllers, we arrive at the BladeGC. I knew I had to have it. Initially, I thought 8BitDo would release a controller like this, or at least some other company, so I was super excited when Retro Fighters announced it. Though I'd still like to get the Hori one some day, it's no longer a must; it's wired and doesn't have features for modern systems. Let's list the upgrades:<br />- grip<br />- analog sticks<br />- two more shoulder buttons<br />- vibration<br />- Switch/PC buttons<br />- wireless (and 2.4 GHz to boot!), with both a dongle for the GameCube and one for USB<br /><br />Already this is the perfect upgrade to the Hori Digital Controller. The little Z button is missing on the front, but of course it's not a requirement.<br /><br />I'll start with commenting on the d-pad. It's\u2026phenomenal. I'm *very* picky about d-pads. Nintendo's of course are best, with Hori a close second. 8BitDo's may feel nice, but they have a habit of mis-presses. This can be remedied by opening the controller and applying binder reinforcement tabs; not ideal, but definitely alleviates the issue. But this d-pad? Damn\u2026 My thumb *skates* across it. When I first opened it, I was a bit disappointed with how it felt. It's low and has straight corners. But during play is when I noticed how marvelous it is. I tried Crash Team Racing, Stardew Valley, and Shredder's Revenge. Every input was precise and correct, and my thumb was able to just skate across it with speed and accuracy. Mein Gott.<br /><br />I haven't extensively used the analog sticks since I didn't get this controller for them, but I tested them with Smash. There's an octagonal gate for each stick, and each movement was comfortable and, for the time I spent using them, precise as well. They're smooth but don't let your thumbs slide off. The tops are flat, with the outer ring (textured for gripping pleasure) jutting up just enough to prevent thumbs from steering off. They don't have as wide an area to move as the GameCube controller, or maybe that's because they're not as tall, but they work well enough. Because of how wonderful this controller feels, I now plan to get the BattlerGC.<br /><br />The vibration is subtle. I'm unsure whether there's an option to change the strength, but the manual doesn't indicate that so I don't think so. It's not too low so as not to feel it; in fact, I think it's the perfect strength if you prefer a little feedback without it dominating the hands. I've had some third-party controllers that freakin' rattled the whole controller. Super uncomfortable. The BladeGC's gives you just a small jolt to remind you that you got hit, loser.<br /><br />And the wireless connectivity? A non-issue. Since this is not Bluetooth, it can't be used with the Switch when in handheld mode; instead, the USB dongle plugs directly to the dock. The Switch then reads it as a wired controller (which must be turned on in settings) and away you go. There is no discernible lag from what I noticed.<br /><br />Now on to the \u201cbad.\u201d<br /><br />Material. The controller is already light enough, but the quality of the plastic is very light and feels hollow. There is no grip texture. Rather, the whole thing is smooth and my hands can slide a bit easily. This is something I noticed with other RF controllers, so I know it isn't just this. Based on how it feels, it doesn't feel like a premium controller, though I certainly consider it one.<br /><br />Stick placement. There is little distance between the right stick and the B button. I have relatively small hands (5'8\", so whatever size hand that coordinates to) and haven't moved the stick accidentally, but I always feel it when pressing the B button. This made me wonder how people with bigger thumbs will experience the controller.<br /><br />But that's it. No more bad. Everything good. Oh, maybe the back shoulder buttons. I prefer ones that stop with a noticeable press, but these go just straight down like a lot of modern shoulder buttons. Gross. Maybe the sticks can be bigger too, but I'll wait until I try the BattlerGC to comment on that.<br /><br />This will be my main controller for RPGs, or any other game that utilizes the d-pad and A button a lot.<br /><br />B for materials and stick placement, A+ for everything else.", "review_title": "Nearly flawless, but flawless for RPGs.", "product": {"title": "Retro Fighters BladeGC Wireless Controller Next-Gen - GameCube, Switch, PC, Gameboy Player Compatible (Orange)", "brand": null, "price": 44.95, "main_category": "Video Games"}}}

It took very little time for these to show their strengths.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed with them is that they are very comfortable. The padding is soft and the cans fit over the ear so there is no pressure on the ear itself. They can be worn for a good period of time without fatigue. The shape of the headphones themselves looks a little odd and as such I was a little concerned that the fit would be off, but this ended up being a non-issue.<br /><br />We plugged them into the computer and immediately they lit up.

They look cool when they\u2019re lit and the lights are not super bright so this is not a bad thing.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. We decided to test them out with some music tracks that have a good range of sound and the headphones managed to give us good reproduction of sound without distortion and without overdriving the highs or lows. These are not quite audiophile quality but they are better than a lot of more expensive headphones I have used. The detail is there too so there should be no problem hearing more subtle sounds without cranking the volume too high.<br /><br />The microphone itself is a little tricky to attach but if one pays attention when trying to attach it, it is not all that difficult.

They are usually either stainless steel or soapstone stones and they get chilled in the freezer for a time before hitting the glass. They cool the surrounding liquid but they themselves do not melt so the drink is not diluted.<br /><br />I have worked with other sets of whiskey stones but these are different. In appearance they are stainless steel stones and there is no reason to believe that they are anything but solid steel cubes when you look at them. However, this is not the case. If you pick one up and shake it gently you can tell quickly that they are actually filled with some form of liquid. It is unclear from the description what this liquid is, but if I had to guess I would assume it is either the same stuff in a freezer pack or an alcohol based slurry.

Four is certainly enough to cool a single beverage, but more allows for sharing with a friend. Adding more cubes is not a functional difference, but more of a social one.<br /><br />I like these cooling cubes. They work a little better than solid stainless steel cubes and they are ready to go in less time in the freezer than other cubes. This is a nice set and I have no issue with recommending it. Just keep in mind that there are only four in the set; if you want to have a drink with a friend you may need another set.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

Because of this I have spent a good deal of time researching other options for pointing devices that are comfortable, including writing/art tablets, track balls, pens and more. I was not thinking about this when I selected this mouse; instead, I was thinking of my son who is a gamer and is always looking for a better mouse. I\u2019m keeping this one for myself.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews here mention that it is a claw-grip mouse, not a palm grip. I disagree, though I admit that I am not a typical user. It fits comfortably in my hand and I can rest the base of my palm on the desk and still reach the buttons comfortably without strain. This is good news for me, as most mice are small enough to require me to tuck in my thumb and contort my hand a little to get a good grip which just makes my hands cramp up.<br /><br />I used the USB dongle to connect to my systems, not Bluetooth, mainly because my Windows computer acts funny with other Bluetooth-based pointing devices. The system saw the dongle, loaded the drivers it needed and the mouse was dead as a doornail because it needed to be charged so it still did not work. I plugged it in, set the mouse to use the USB connection and it worked somewhat as a wired mouse while it charged (it was communicating via the dongle but getting power through the wire).

Nancy is taking a well-deserved vacation at the Ryokan Hiei, a traditional inn in Kyoto, Japan. From the moment Nancy arrives, there are spooky omens, and the Shimizu family isn't very talkative about the family tragedy that hangs over the ryokan. Part of Nancy's job is to teach English through the Japan Teacher Exchange program, so you'll have various homework assignments to grade in the evenings. Because you're teaching all day, the game takes place at night, adding to the creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />Shadow at the Water's Edge is one of the scariest games next to Curse of Blackmoor Manor (note that the game is rated E (10+), so there's no gore or violence, but there are some heart-stopping moments). Various paranormal phenomena follow Nancy as she attempts to discover the secrets hiding inside the ryokan, and these were genuinely scary, since several were still unexplained after the finale. This is also one of the longest Nancy Drew games, with ample opportunity for sleuthing, snooping, and interviewing. You'll have the opportunity to hop on the subway as well as conduct phone interviews in your quest for the truth behind the hauntings.<br /><br />The game designers did a good job on incorporating Japanese culture into the game. You'll find Harajuku-inspired fashion, traditional Japanese gardens, cute cell phone charms, and customizable cell phone avatars that you can assign to your cell contacts (design enough, and you can win an award at the end of the game). I loved the little authentic touches, like the very Japanese hot water heater perched over Yumi's apartment sink. Nancy also has a Japanese-English dictionary to help her translate written items. The in-game music ranges from soothing, traditional Japanese instrumentals to ominous taiko drumming and sudden, eerie starts and stops that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />Gameplay is nonlinear. You can advance the game by setting your cell phone alarm; some actions can only be accomplished at certain times. There are numerous logic puzzles based on Japanese favorites like sudoku, renograms, and nonograms, along with several Japanese cultural lessons offered. If you're not a fan of sudoku and math puzzles, consider yourself warned, as you'll spend most of the game solving a variety of them. This is also one of the more difficult Nancy Drew games; I played the game on the Junior level, and ended up resorting to a walkthrough.

Nancy actually gets to snoop around...at night. There's a definite sense of danger; you can die, but there's a handy second chance feature. All of the suspects have something to hide; you'll find your opinion constantly changing based on what you unearth in your explorations.

In SAW, when you're in Japan, cell phone charms are all the rage and it makes sense to see them in the game, but it seemed out of place in an Egyptian tomb.<br /><br />**Final verdict:**<br /><br />Since I've always been interested in Egypt, there is some replay value; the graphics are simply gorgeous, and you'll see plenty of familiar names and faces from Ancient Egyptian culture, but if you're looking for edge-of-your seat drama like SAW, sadly Nancy won't find it in Egypt.", "review_full": "To sum up this game in one word: tedious. That's unfortunate, since there was so much that could have been done with the setting and theme.<br /><br />**First impressions...**<br /><br />The first thing you notice is that the traditional \"Nancy's desk\" intro is gone. So, too, is any sort of exposition; I felt as if I'd just been dropped into the desert with no backstory or idea of what was going on. As you have conversations with the suspects and phone friends, you start to put the pieces together, but that came fairly late in the game for me.<br /><br />Most notably, there are very few settings and few hotspots to interact with. There are really only two main locations, the campsite and the tomb. You can pan around the camp, but despite several close-up shots, there's rarely anything to click on. Some background animations (palm branches waving in the desert wind, perhaps some glowing embers from the campfire, scuttling scarabs) would have done wonders to bring the dig site to life. Inside the main tent, it feels like wasted space. You can't pan, and there's nothing to explore inside the bunks. Even items that seemed like they should be explorable (like a purse left out in the open) aren't clickable. You see shelves in the tent; my first thought was, \"aha, supplies!\" but once again, there's no hotspots. There are several snooping puzzles that require you to go through personal belongings, and as mentioned above, there's hardly anything clickable despite lots of potential \"hotspots\" (a digital camera that I was sure would have incriminating evidence, a voice recorder like the one from SAW, but I couldn't click on either).<br /><br />**Puzzles**<br /><br />The puzzles are tedious; it felt like all I kept doing was finding and translating hieroglyphs. On the Amateur Sleuth level, you can skip all the hieroglyph translation by clicking on the \"quick translate\" button. Even some of the puzzles shamelessly repeat themselves during the course of the game. You're given several archeological tools appropriate for a dig site; it's a shame that the game didn't require you to make more use of them.<br /><br />I kept getting lost in the tunnels. True, you're given a map, but it lacks a \"you are here\" feature, and the tunnels look very similar in some cases. More importantly, there was no sense of foreboding, no sense that Nancy really is being stalked by an otherworldly curse. Nancy debunks the \"curse\" events almost immediately after they happen, which takes away any sense of suspense that would have otherwise been generated. I felt no sense of urgency, no hair standing up on the back of my neck, nothing that seemed creepy/spooky like the yurei in [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]] (watery footprints, ghostly reflections, etc.).<br /><br />The character rendering and animation was generally good, but some of the mannerisms (Dylan's constantly putting his arm behind his head, Abdullah's accent) were grating and repetitive. Two of the character accents were particularly grating; Abdullah sounded like a close cousin of Antonio Banderas channeling Puss in Boots, and Jamila sounded like she just stepped out of a British boarding school (both are supposed to be Egyptian).<br /><br />**Chatting up the suspects**<br /><br />It didn't seem like there were many conversation branches to pursue, and some of the follow-up questions didn't make sense (a character would spend two or three minutes giving an answer, and the next question was \"why are you here?\").<br /><br />Some of the scripted conversations seemed a bit questionable. One involved a crack about the British Empire, and the other involved a scenario that sounded a lot like the Book of Revelation and the Rapture, if you subscribe to that sort of thing. This surprised me, as ND games are generally neutral towards political and religious themes.<br /><br />Character-wise, there seems to be more depth and backstory than in many ND games, and the ending is brilliant; you're never quite sure who the villain is until the very end (shades of Agatha Christie here).<br /><br />**Setting**<br /><br />I feel let down that modern-day Egypt was completely overlooked. Unlike [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] or [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]], where you had traditional foods, games, etc. from Italy and Japan, there's nothing to tie TMB to modern Egypt, only the ancient past. You only deal with hieroglyphs and no modern Arabic. A little of both would have worked wonders. It would have been awesome for Nancy to visit a traditional Cairo souk (market), ride a camel to see the pyramids and Sphynx at Giza (even a cutscene would have sufficed) or have to travel between the dig site and a museum to interview / look for clues. Instead, you're confined to one location with few people to talk to, mostly phone friends, which grew old quickly, but the remoteness of the dig site is a central part of the plot.<br /><br />The problem with TMB is that the temples and Egyptian artifacts lack any kind of context or historical explanation. I would have preferred to see TMB be more like [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]], where Nancy was an intern in a museum. There, the educational games felt natural and I learned a lot at the same time. Another good example of the ancient Egyptian genre is [[ASIN:B0017AJMX8 Dracula Origin]]; it had one part that was set in modern Egypt; there you got to hunt for artifacts in the museum, translate hieroglyphs, and it was actually fun.<br /><br />**The new interface**<br /><br />I thought the new interface worked well and made it easy to access important information. The Hints Hotline was in use almost constantly, since I was frequently stuck (it progressively gives you hints until you have the option to see the full solution; this is done in red font, so you can avoid seeing the complete solution if you choose).<br /><br />Also, I  had some issues with the scrolling text boxes during conversations. The letters on the left-hand side kept getting chopped off, so you'd have to guess at the first letter or two of words. Not a major issue, but a bit annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />There are also phone charms to collect, but these seemed totally out of place in Ancient Egypt. In SAW, when you're in Japan, cell phone charms are all the rage and it makes sense to see them in the game, but it seemed out of place in an Egyptian tomb.<br /><br />**Final verdict:**<br /><br />Since I've always been interested in Egypt, there is some replay value; the graphics are simply gorgeous, and you'll see plenty of familiar names and faces from Ancient Egyptian culture, but if you're looking for edge-of-your seat drama like SAW, sadly Nancy won't find it in Egypt. The plot kind of grew on me as the game progressed, but more explorable areas, particularly above-ground, would have gone a long way to making TMB feel less claustrophobic.<br /><br />The teaser for ND27 looks promising!<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Beautiful graphics<br />+ Music<br />+ Ancient Egyptian culture<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Accents<br />- Lack of hotspots / animation<br />- Lack of areas to explore<br />- Repetitive puzzles", "review_title": "Beautiful, but tedious.", "product": {"title": "Nancy Drew: Tomb of the Lost Queen", "brand": null, "price": 19.72, "main_category": "Video Games"}}, {"parent_asin": "B00C9UND8U", "rating": 4.0, "timestamp_ms": 1368526532000, "review_excerpt": "However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.<br /><br />SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it.

I loved the combination of culture, history, and mystery in these games.<br /><br />In Ghost of Thornton Hall, Nancy is called upon to find Jessalyn Thornton, a missing bride-to-be on Blackrock Island, ancestral home of the Thornton family. Thornton Hall is a dilapidated antebellum mansion flanked by skeletal moss-draped trees and a crypt / graveyard. Like CRY, you'll spend the entire game at night, which means lots of dark lighting (and ambiance). As other reviewers have pointed out, GTH felt a bit like a mashup of [[ASIN:B003BHGWMY Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and Legend of the Crystal Skull (missing bride-to-be + lots of time spent in graveyards / crypts).<br /><br />You'll spend much of the game untangling two separate mysteries: piecing together the puzzle of the missing bride-to-be as well as the death of Charlotte Thornton, whose ghost is said to haunt Blackrock Island. Nancy has the chance to interrogate several members of the Thornton family, although I would have liked to see more actual snooping (there's definitely much less snooping than in earlier games...and where do these people sleep / eat since no one apparently has a room at the house?).<br /><br />You're limited to three main locations; I would have liked a couple of extra rooms to explore within Thornton Hall (one humorous random ND moment: there's a tea set where you can make yourself unlimited tea, and then I realized that this was one of the few games without a bathroom!). A few more hotspots would have been nice, too (Jessalyn's purse is on the floor, but you can't explore it. Wait, shouldn't there be some evidence in there??). However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.<br /><br />SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it. Creepy events happen in every room at any moment, and combined with the eerie music (which has a great vocal / cello soundtrack), keep you on the edge of your seat. For me, the biggest cop-out was the supposed explanation for these at the end of the game...which wouldn't have explained all the sightings anyway. The game was morbid more than scary; there are several surprisingly dark subplots and possible endings for an ND game, and several of the conversations involve some pretty black humor on the part of one character in particular.<br /><br />The puzzles offered sufficient variety, but I would have liked to see more use made of the ghost hunting equipment that Savannah Woodham left for Nancy; it's pretty obvious that the hauntings are off the charts, but you only use it for one puzzle and then you're done (SAW was great about using EVP recorders and the like to try and capture evidence).<br /><br />If you're stuck, you can use the hint feature if you're playing as an Amateur Sleuth. Another cool touch is that there are three possible endings depending on how you play out the final scenario. It was fun playing through all three to see the different endings, which also added replay value. One feature that I liked was that you can instantly see which awards you've earned throughout the course of the game using the new trophy menu display; each time you earn a new award, you'll get a notification (there are A LOT of possible awards this time around, adding to the replay value). And there's FINALLY a feature that lets you fast-forward through conversations, which is especially handy if you're replaying the game.<br /><br />The game's atmosphere, music, graphics and story were great; it's definitely one of the best games from the last couple of years post-SAW, but it still seemed short compared to earlier games like Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge. However, if you're a fan of \"spooky\" ND games like Mystery in a Haunted Mansion, Legend of the Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge, you'll love Ghost of Thornton Hall!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plot<br />Graphics<br />Music<br />Creepy atmosphere<br />New features (fast-forward through conversations, new trophy menu)<br />Replay value<br /><br />Cons:<br />Seemed short<br />Could have benefitted from a few extra rooms / locations to explore<br />You spend a lot of time backtracking, especially later in the game<br />Contains some pretty heavy / dark topics for younger players", "review_title": "Dear sweet Charlotte, please come back....", "product": {"title": "Nancy Drew: Ghost of Thornton Hall - PC/Mac", "brand": null, "price": 21.88, "main_category": "Video Games"}}, {"parent_asin": "B00O2GW3EO", "rating": 3.0, "timestamp_ms": 1416177624000, "review_excerpt": "I had no issues with the PC install on Windows 8.1, but the &#34;free&#34; mobile McAfee app I started getting e-mails about did not work and I uninstalled it.<br /><br />Compared to other &#34;premium&#34; packages I've used in the past (including Endpoint), the interface is very, very basic and does not seem to allow for advanced options.

With incredibly lifelike modeling and rendering (you can practically count the pores on characters faces), a wide range of immersive environments with real-time effects (blowing leaves, running water, etc.), and plenty of intrigue to keep both Holmes and Watson busy, the game most certainly is afoot.<br /><br />Crimes and Punishments is not a linear story; rather, it is made up of six separate games loosely connected by the appearance of the Merry Men, a gang of terrorists. Several of the stories are taken from canon (Black Peter, Abbey Grange).<br /><br />As you play through the first case, on-screen guidance explains the gameplay basics. As Sherlock, you have several tools at your disposal, including a research library of encyclopedias and newspapers, a laboratory where you will be required to perform different types of chemical analyses, and Toby, the best nose in the British empire. You also have a full wardrobe of potential disguises including a makeup table; this will be of importance at several points in the game. At certain points, you have the chance to switch between Sherlock and Watson, a constable, and Toby, the \u201cbest nose in the British Empire.\u201d<br /><br />There are several new features here from previous installments of Frogwares\u2019 series, including Sherlock's mind palace, where you visually connect glowing synapses as new clues are unearthed, leading you to a series of possible conclusions as to the culprit(s). Depending on the conclusions you reach, various suspects will be pronounced guilty. Sherlock then has the additional responsibility of deciding whether to arrest or absolve each killer. Another feature is Sherlock's in-depth analysis of characters; you have the ability to slowly pan over each suspect, and Sherlock points out various facts that will enable you to unlock key plot points based on these observations. Sherlock also has two additional tools in his arsenal; one allowed you to observe details that others would miss (this is accomplished through a filter than also distorts background sounds), and the other allows you to mentally recreate an object (this is a mini puzzle in itself as each \u201cmental object\u201d requires manipulation to function).<br /><br />The locations range from grimy London alleys to Roman ruins, elaborate Chinese temples, and stately manors. Each felt totally unique and distinct from the others; in fact I was floored by the attention to detail and number of explorable areas as other detective games I have played give a much smaller venue.  In addition to puzzles (which range from frequently easy to very difficult), there are a series of mini-games that involve boxing, archery, chemical analysis, recreating objects, and a whole lot of lockpicking. These mini games can be skipped, which will drastically shorten the length of the game. It\u2019s also obvious that the mini games were designed with console gaming in mind, as accomplishing some of them on a computer keyboard (without a joypad) is pretty much impossible, but I was able to accomplish most of them successfully.<br /><br />I found the length of the cases to be a bit uneven; for example, the first, second, and fourth cases felt shorter in comparison to the other three. I also felt the second case was the weakest of the six as the locations all felt extremely repetitive and I had deduced the basic plot very early into my investigation. The disguise feature is a great idea, but it seems to only have an effect at a couple of points in the game; it would have been interesting to see how suspects and NPCs reacted to Sherlock depending on his outfit at a given time. I would have also liked to see greater weight placed on the morality system; you are notified if you made the correct deduction, then told what percentage of fellow Steam gamers made the same judgment call. Once you make a final decision, the game erases all save points for that case, so if you want to see various endings, be sure to do so BEFORE accepting the final decision.<br /><br />There are also a number of awards that can be earned for accomplishing various cases, conversations, and minigames, which adds to the replay value.<br /><br />Voice acting was generally excellent, with dialogue that felt true to the characters and the period. The banter between Sherlock and Watson (and Sherlock's jibes at Lestrade and his brother Mycroft) felt true to the original stories. Even Mrs. Hudson makes an appearance, as do the Baker Street Irregulars and Bill Wiggins, who play a key role in several of the cases.<br /><br />Fans of BBC Sherlock, the original Conan Doyle stories, and detective novels in general (especially if you are a fan of the older Agatha Christie PC games as I am) will find much to recommend Sherlock; the graphics are simply stunning, the environments are totally immersive, and the replay value is high as there are so many potential outcomes, optional clues, minigames, and awards to earn.

Sylvie Pelletier, child of French Canadien immigrants, travels with her mother and siblings from Vermont, to a company town in Colorado. Her father works for Padgett Fuel and Stone Company as a quarryman. It is 1907. Why have they traveled to this remote collection of rough cabins, eight miles up a treacherous, icy mountain road from \"the prettified coal town of Ruby\", then on past the town of Moonstone, with a store, a church and a jail to Cabin 6?<br /><br />Manning brings alive the grim reality of life in a company town. Workers are often paid in scrip. They receive no pay for the many hours they are required to work to keep the road clear or for any time they are expected to work beyond their shift. The work is hard and they have barely enough to pay rent and buy food. This is a marble mine with virtually no safety protocols.  Moving slabs of marble is dangerous work and accidents, including deadly ones are common. There is talk of a union. Sylvie's father is one of the people at the center of the talk, having left Vermont at gunpoint because of his labor organizing activities. His current tendency to talk up unions is unsettling to his wife and unacceptable to his employer. He could lose his job at the whim of the manager and their home along with it.<br /><br />Sylvie and her older brother attend school. Their toddler brother is home with their mother. Sylvie is a talented student. She wins an essay contest with the local newspaper selecting a daring topic., The Moonstone City Record's female editor is college educated, fiercely independent and progressive. Obviously, she, too is unacceptable to the Padgetts as she increasingly writes critical articles about their employment practices and mine safety.  Miss Redmond hires Sylvie to work for her setting type. Eventually she lets Sylvie report on family news and accidents at the mine.<br /><br />Because she is bilingual in French and English, Sylvie is invited to apply for a position with the mine owners' wife as a secretary for the summer. \"Duke\" Padgett is obscenely wealthy, with holdings far beyond this mine.. He's from Richmond Virginia and his wife (the \"Countess\") is from Belgium, where they met in King Leopold's Court. They summer near Moonstone, living  in the lavish home they built, Elkhorn Mansion, entertaining visitors from all over.  Guests are treated to balls dinners including oysters from the East and other costly delicacies.  Duke's son Jasper, attends Harvard but he is also in Moonstone for the summer. Two of Duke's former slaves, John and Easter Grady work there as cook and driver. The Grady's son Caleb is there for the summer and serves as a chef on the Padgetts' private railroad car. Their other son, Marcus, is in a different part of Colorado where he hopes to participate in building a town for \"Negroes.\" Jasper is very close to the Gradys, as Easter took care of him when his mother died.<br /><br />Sylvie experiences the harsh reality of her father's work and the risks he takes when he encourages his fellow workers to consider fairer treatment. She sees what her mother must do in their meager surroundings to care for her family and help provide for them. She witnesses a variety of immigrant families' adjustment to the harsh conditions of Colorado Mountain winters with no pay because the mine is shut down for the season. She is subjected to harsh comments about the newspaper and her role there. She's spent eight weeks with a front row seat to people living at a level of luxury she could not have imagined. During that time, she connected personally with the Countess, who made something of a pet of her. She connected personally with Jasper almost as a friend. Later, Sylvie meets Mother Jones and the organizer sent by the national union. She's there, when they speak to her father and his coworkers and she's there for the backlash. Pinkerton men arrive, vicious and heartless. She witnesses the challenges faced by the Gradys in seeking how to make their way independently. Ultimately, all of these people interact with Sylvie in life-changing ways that make for an amazing story of the people of turn of the century Colorado.<br /><br />So,  this is the story of one smart, attractive and courageous girl's life.  We learn how a variety of opportunities, challenges and a range of people from different classes, countries and backgrounds shape who she is. She takes risks.  She makes choices that a situationally moral but would put her in jail if she were discovered. She sometimes follows her heart and loses her way.

She was the eldest child, the \"mistake\" that led to her parent's hasty marriage. Her mother died when she was thirteen. Her father, always a heavy drinker never did well after that . The youngest four children are parceled out to strangers, leaving Joan and her younger sister, the next to oldest, to find work and keep house. While working at a candy factory, not far from the estate, Joan finds herself flirting with a bike messenger for Egan & Son Builders Merchants & Suppliers, a thriving family business. We know early on that she married the messenger, Martin Egan, son of widow Molly Egan who runs the business. Throughout their marriage, almost thirty years,  Joan and Martin have a kept a secret.  Jiwa unfolds their  story moving back and forth between the mid 1960s, the mid-1990s and and covers other aspects of Joan's life through her memories of the period before she met Martin. And before April. ,<br /><br />Fortunately for my review of this lovely novel that brings Joan to us, the publicity for the book put Martin and Joan's secret out there. In 1966, before they were married, Joan gave birth to their daughter, April, in London.  Martin had to be there for awhile and they could hide the scandal of her pregnancy by having Joan stay in a boarding house and give birth to the baby there. They gave her up for adoption and later married and lived as if the there never was an April.<br /><br />Before she married Martin, Joan had responsibilities but she lived a fairly independent life with a strong, intelligent personality and high standards for herself. Marrying Martin meant living with his mother in his upscale childhood home where Joan never feels accepted. Martin never gets around to finding a separate house for the newlyweds.  Molly is a snob who certainly didn't expect her son to marry down as he did. When Martin and Joan have their daughter Carmel, Joan cannot connect emotionally with her new baby. Every day she thinks about April.  Molly and Martin  make Joan almost irrelevant to her daughter. She does exercise independence when she insists on working in the business instead of being a homemaker.  But... Joan is never Joan again. The loving passionate relationship she had with Martin withers. They do not connect as a couple.  He falls into the lure of making money, making his difficult mother as happy as possible and doting on Carmel.  Their relationship moves from mutual respect and deep love to a transactional arrangement.  Marrying up has made Joans old friends and neighbors avoid her and has not turned out to be the story she imagined when Martin and she got to know each other with little thought on her part about his money and privilege.<br /><br />And then, thirty years after April's birth, a letter arrives from London. April needs help that only her biological family can offer and decisions must be made. Carmel works for the business and is a whiz. She is not in on the secret. Molly certainly will erupt if she finds out. Martin desperately wants to keep their secret and go on with the pretense there never was an April and that Joan is just being sentimental.<br /><br />Jiwa's gift to us is Joan, who lost huge chunks of herself along the way but never forgot what mattered to her and what she lost.  The book is the re-making of Joan. Jiwa shares her innermost thoughts with us at every stage.  This is a first person story of how Joan got where she is, emotionally damaged at a young age, showing tremendous spirit but then, losing part of herself and no longer fighting to be Joan. There are steps she can take that maintain the secret, possibly forever.  Each step she takes or considers moves her to greater understanding of herself, the family she grew up in and who she needs to be.

Angela was fired when her employer found out she is pregnant. Angela is gay. Angela and her wife have been trying for a baby for awhile. This pregnancy is a little scary because she had a miscarriage with her first positive test. As Angela is working in the shop, she opens a drawer and finds a seven year old letter, sent to Nancy Mitchell from her mother Frances. It's obvious this was misdirected mail meant for the apartment upstairs. Frances had her lawyer send this after her death. She tells Nancy she was adopted and encloses a note from Nancy's birth mother. Angela starts looking for Nancy and eventually as she keeps striking out, she also looks for Nancy's birth mother, Margaret.<br /><br />In 1960, when Evelyn's fianc\u00e9 died of a heart attack, she was already pregnant with their child. Her parents gave her no choice. She was whisked off to St. Agnes' Home for Unwed Mothers and disowned. When Evelyn's daughter was born, she too was whisked off-- to be adopted. No choice there, although in this case, Evelyn desperately wanted to have her brother and his wife adopt her baby.  The baby's name was Jane. Evelyn secreted a note to the adoptive parents and a pair of yellow booties in Jane's blanket and that was that. Evelyn always mourned this loss and made unsuccessful efforts to find Jane.  Looking for Jane.<br /><br />Years later, Evelyn, now a doctor, gets involved in providing women with illegal abortions that are carried out in a medically safe and very private way. Nancy has helped a cousin get a \"back alley\" abortion and she requires emergency room care due to bleeding. The male doctor is hostile and tells them that when Evelyn comes on for the next shift, she will likely call the police. Instead, Evelyn tells Nancy that if she ever learns of anyone else needing an abortion, the woman should call any gynecology office and ask for Jane. Evelyn has joined the \"Jane\" network, a group that is based on a similar network that existed in Chicago before abortion was legalized via Roe v. Wade.<br /><br />Looking for Jane follows these women's stories in a nonlinear fashion, drawing us into the past and present of these remarkable and very ordinary women. Marshall writes a compelling and entertaining story throughout, although the ending is a bit much. That's all I'll say about that. It was entertaining both because of and in spite of the ending.

After her father died in a car accident, her grief was almost unbearable. Not only because she missed him so, but also because she was carrying a secret burden. She knows that the wreck happened while he was on his way to hear her sing in a concert, so Rae feels responsible. She also has a lot of hidden resentment toward her mother, who did not tell her the entire truth about the details of the accident, which Rae already knew because she overheard what the police officer told her mom that terrible night\u2026<br />Now Rae is a sophomore, and has classes again with people who witnessed her break-down last year over a discussion about \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d, one of her dad\u2019s favorites. People who basically told her she needed to get serious help, or they would \u201ctake a break\u201d from their friendships with her\u2026including her best friend.<br />Upon reluctantly accepting an invitation to audition for the school play, Rae\u2019s outlook on life begins gradually to become more positive, because her group of new theater friends accepts her immediately with warmth and approval. In addition to her work in the play, Rae reaches out with them to make a difference in their community by taking on a project that she hopes will be a fitting legacy for her dad\u2026<br />So many, many positive things to say about this book! The compassion shown by Rae and those involved with her in the theater in their \u201cpay it forward\u201d projects was wonderful; I think teachers could incorporate many of the group\u2019s ideas into their own curriculums. Every character was drawn vividly by the author, \u201cwarts\u201d and all. The love that Rae had for her father and for the 80\u2019s rock bands like Bon Jovi that he adored (23 concerts attended!) is a tender, heart-rending aspect of this book that makes it a very special and unique read. Lastly, I want to thank this author for writing a Y.A. book, set in modern times, in which the teen characters are not drinking, smoking,doing drugs, having sex, and dropping f-bombs and other curse words everywhere. This book was like a breath of fresh air compared to many Y.A. books written about today\u2019s society!<br />*I am posting an honest review for this book, that I received from Book Sirens.*", "review_title": "Young Adult Fiction At Its Best!", "product": {"title": "I'll Be There For You", "brand": null, "price": 5.99, "main_category": "Buy a Kindle"}}}

Always a bone of contention among fans, probably because -- like the '60s film years -- it was allowed to go on too long and Elvis found himself in another artistic rut.  Happily, the downturn had yet to really take hold at the time of Elvis On Tour.  He was still involved and committed and enjoying it all in 1972, and fans -- both newbies and long term -- were the better for it all.  This collection's highlights include three previously unreleased full shows as well as a remixed concert, rehearsals, and behind the curtain RCA Studio C, Hollywood tracks, plus the BluRay version of the original film release.  A visit to Elvis Nirvana for Elvis diehards.  What would've made it all the better, for me anyway, would have been the reconstruction of the Standing Room Only (original, discarded title) soundtrack album.  That proposed 1972 LP was sacrificed in favor of the Madison Square Garden album (which actually even copped its cover photo!).

Handled with more care and a bit of artistic vision, the session's resulting material could have been presented (and remembered) in a much more favorable light.  A pop album.  A country album.

The call-and-response chorus owed much to traditional gospel. O'Kelly Jr., Rudolph and Ronald Isley formed the Isley Brothers in 1954 and started out recording doo-wop in New York. In 1959, they signed with RCA Records; in 1962, they signed with Wand and scored their first Top 40 single with \"Twist & Shout.\" In 1965, the group signed with Motown's Tamla imprint. 1966 saw the release of \"This Old Heart Of Mine (Is Weak For You),\" a Holland-Dozier-Holland gem that reached No. 12 on the Hot 100 and No. 6 in R&B (it was originally intended for the Supremes).  However, the Isley Brothers couldn't come up with a commercially successful follow-up, and complained of being given \"leftover\" tracks originally written for other Motown acts. The Isleys never really fit in with the spit-and-polish Motown promotional machine; in the words of a BBC reviewer,  the Isley Brothers \"were not cheerily going to visit the charm school and perform all the ditzy promotional routines that Motown expected of its roster.\" They parted ways with Motown in 1968. Flash-forward two decades: in 1989, Ronald Isley and Rod Stewart released a Top 10 duet version of \"This Old Heart of Mine\" that reached #10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and spent five weeks at #1 on the US adult contemporary chart.<br /><br />It's true that the Isleys did record a large number of Motown cover songs by the Supremes, Valadiers/Monitors, etc., but that was common practice at the label (Stevie Wonder covered the Four Tops, Kim Weston covered the Supremes, David Ruffin covered the Jackson 5; see [[ASIN:B000BPI2AE Motown Sings Motown Treasures]] for more examples). They had a huge following in the UK with hits like \"Behind a Painted Smile\" and \"I Guess I'll Always Love You,\" and ended up touring England after their split from Motown. But as evidenced on this collection of 52 tracks, there were plenty of gems during their brief tenure at Hitsville USA: \"Put Yourself In My Place,\" \"Why When Love Is Gone,\" the soul-drenched \"Seek and You Shall Find,\" \"Take Some Time Out For Love,\" and the standout: beautiful, tender \"My Love Is Your Love Forever\" (Ronald Isley's tenor never sounded sweeter). Even their cover versions of the Supremes (\"Stop! In the Name of Love,\" \"Nowhere to Run,\" \"I Hear a Symphony\"), Elgins (\"Put Yourself in My Place,\" which went to #13 in the UK) and Marvin Gaye (\"Baby Don't You Do It\") add a fresh new sound to the originals.

Luka \u008aulic & Stjepan Hauser have lined up twelve songs ranging from U2 to Michael Jackson, Sting to NIN, even a dash of Guns n' Roses. However, what makes them unique from their competition is that these songs are totally unaccompanied other than Luka and Stjepan's blazing bows. That's right; no fancy orchestras, no studio wizardry, no overdubs...just...two cellos. If that sounds a little awkward, it really works in the context of most of the songs. Cellists Luka and Stjepan go beyond their classical roots and evoke any number of effects from their cellos, including rapid-fire bowing, pizzicato, and percussive slaps (think flamenco guitar). They bounce the melodies back and forth like a musical badminton match, seamlessly picking up lines from each other. The two have an amazing chemistry, even more so live (which is how they were first discovered after uploading one of their duets to YouTube and landing a guest spot on Ellen).<br /><br />\"Smooth Criminal\" is obviously one of the most high-profile of the songs here, if only because David Garrett did a stellar violin cover on [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]] (ditto for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]). As these tracks are all acoustic, it can't compete with the tension of the original recording (or the opening drums and strings on David's version of \"Smooth Criminal\"), but it holds its own (the opening aggressive bowing is kind of painful; imagine a cello with laryngitis, and that's the kind of tone they're pulling out in the intro). I actually thought Luka and Stjepan's cover of \"Human Nature\" was more impressive, capturing the soft, dreamy feel of the chorus.

They're both young, very handsome, and a little edgy (2Cellos in particular both look like they could be the leads in [[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]), all of which will appeal to a wider range of fans than a strictly classical repertoire would. Both groups pay homage to influential bands with slightly different approaches. I found the acoustic cello-centric approach fascinating; in the absence of studio effects, Luka and Stjepan are forced to create their own soundscapes using nothing more than the cello.<br /><br />I really enjoyed their debut album, and look forward to hearing much more from 2Cellos in the near future!", "review_title": "2Cellos steals the show!", "product": {"title": "2Cellos", "brand": null, "price": 9.98, "main_category": "Digital Music"}}], "heldout": {"parent_asin": "B0097BY3K6", "rating": 5.0, "timestamp_ms": 1353882549000, "review_excerpt": "The Deluxe Edition features a Region 0 DVD with five videos (\"Viva La Vida,\" The Making of Viva La Vida, \"Tico Tico\" (live from Hannover), \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" (live from Hannover) and \"Funiculi Funicula\" (live from Hanover).

You'll also find a nod to James Bond rocking a riff from Led Zepplin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" and some Latin American and Celtic vibes on Tico Tico and Celtic Rondo.<br /><br />Most thrilling, David has gotten back to recording high-octane classical covers; the Beethoven Scherzo brings to mind the rollicking score from Pirates of the Caribbean. \"Sabre Dance\" bursts out of the gate with some serious electric guitar and turns it into a headbanging anthem. \"Whole Lotta Bond\" is a great update on a classic theme. There are slower, gentler sides of David in Chopin's \"Nocturne,\" Clementi - \"Sonata\" and \"Ode to Joy.\"<br /><br />And let me be the first to say that I am NOT a fan of the cardboard packaging; it arrived from Germany slightly dented, and I had a devil of a time getting the discs out. You'll find the bilingual liner notes and three gorgeous photo \"postcards\" tucked into the middle. The Deluxe Edition features a Region 0 DVD with five videos (\"Viva La Vida,\" The Making of Viva La Vida, \"Tico Tico\" (live from Hannover), \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" (live from Hannover) and \"Funiculi Funicula\" (live from Hanover). And it's great to finally see David literally letting his hair down in the liner notes (if there isn't a \"David Garrett's hair\" fanclub, I volunteer to start one!).<br /><br />Overall, Music is closest in composition to [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]], which still ranks as my #1 David album of all time for its balance of uptempo, classical, and original compositions. This is a must-have for new and old fans alike; be sure to spring for the Deluxe Edition if you can find it! And DEFINITELY spring for the Blu-Ray concert DVD of Music, which is currently only available through Amazon.de (ASIN: B009D2RQ30) It is PAL Region 0 and plays just fine on my Sony Blu-Ray DVD player. There are 28 tracks, including pretty much ALL the songs (and bonus tracks) from Music. There are even English subtitles for all of David's German intros!", "review_title": "David does it again...", "product": {"title": "Music", "brand": null, "price": 10.9, "main_category": "Digital Music"}}}

In contrast, \"reveal entire puzzle\" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a \"press-and-hold-on-clue\" popup.

It wasn't clear what the difference between the two is and secure connection is limited to 200mb a day unless you pay extra to remove the limitation.  There is a lot in the product including the ability to encrypt files, a password manager and a system vulnerability scanner and fixer.  It even includes a backup and restore program and parental controls.  It doesn't seem too resource hungry, which is why I had to abandon some products in the past; they just slowed the computer too much.  Overall, it seems like a really nice package and rates highly in virus detection.  You won't go wrong buying this product.  So why only 4 stars?  Well, I am rating the specific package that I got.  I was disappointed when I opened the package, because it is nothing except an activation key and a few pages of instructions.  I ran into problems right away with the instructions.  It recommends signing up at my.kaspersky.com where you can enter and manage your license(s).  I tried repeatedly to add my license after signing up and could not do it; kept getting the message that it wasn't able to and to try again later.  Finally it just said the license had expired.  I gave up and used a different tactic and I recommend you do this too if you buy one of these license packages.  I just went to the main website, downloaded and installed the product.  Then when I ran it, it requested the activation key, which I entered.  Everything went fine then.  A word about support.  When I ran into the difficultly on my.kaspersky.com, I contacted support and they responded very quickly in just a few hours.  I hope this is an indication of their usual levels of support.  I was impressed.  You won't go wrong with Kaspersky, but remember nothing will protect you completely.  There is no substitute for practicing safe computing.  Update: Kaspersky will not install on Windows XP if your disks are FAT32.  Your disks have to be NTFS.  You can convert from FAT32 to NTFS, but there are risks of losing your data if you do that.", "review_title": "Very comprehensive and easy to use; installation instructions were useless", "product": {"title": "Kaspersky Total Security 2017 | 3 Device/1 Year (Key Card)", "brand": null, "price": 43.72, "main_category": "Software"}}}

When I got a chance to get a reviewer subscription to Babbel.com I jumped at it.<br /><br />Initially, I kind of didn't like Babbel.  It seemed a little clumsy.  You need to do a lot of typing, which doesn't work well on my iPhone and was somewhat frustrating on my ipad as the window jumped around when the keyboard came up.  But when I pulled it up on my touch screen laptop, it really worked fairly well.  And, once I got over the \"inconvenience\" of having to type in Spanish words (something Duolingo seems to have limited,) I found that it really helped me to focus on gender and spellings.  It actually became a very good teaching tool, although it took a little familiarity.  You are prompted with lettered buttons that show the letters in the word, which seems like a little too much for a cue.<br /><br />I really liked a number of things that helped my learning.  First, it features a different word set than duolingo, even for the same objects.  I like that I got a different vocabulary.  I also liked that they would put the beginner words into sentences that were unapologetically complex.  It was nice to have more challenging sentences than could be made with the beginner words and when I sampled intermediate and advanced levels, I found that Advanced is an immersion experience that I really like.  Lastly, I think that Babbel does a better job of giving helpful rules for Spanish.  They are brief but seem to stick.<br /><br />The bad things I found was that it gets a little repetitive and grows a little tiring. One of the beginner features is speech recognition which is not working well for me.  Duolingo speech recognition seems a little more tolerant.  With Babbel I find there are some words and phrases it will just not recognize, but this actually focuses me on pronunciation, so this might be good, if a little frustrating.  Definitely use a headset as built in microphones definitely don't work as well.<br /><br />All in all, a good resource with its pros and cons.

I'm also a huge fan of Iran's rich cultural tapestry and have had several Iranian acquaintances over the years. So when I saw on Rick's blog that he was filming a one-hour special on Iran, I rushed over to Hulu to watch it. Rick takes you on a journey from Iran's metropolitan capital Tehran to Abyaneh, Esfahan, Shiraz and Persepolis.<br /><br />The opening shot of Tehran's buildings silhouetted against the smog-shrouded Alborz Mountains is carried by a breathy nay and santur soundtrack. The colors of Tehran's streets are crisp and bright, a stark contrast to the women gliding silently by in black chadors. I loved the portraits of everyday Iranians that showcased the complexity of Iran's cultural heritage: in addition to Persians, there are Greek, Arab, Turkish, Mongol, and Azerbaijani descendents. Rick makes sure to point out that Iranians are NOT Arabs, and they don't speak Arabic. The national language is Farsi (also spoken in neighboring Afghanistan, where it is called Dari). Although Farsi uses a modified Arabic script with several letters not found in Arabic (p, ch, zhe, and g), Farsi is a completely separate language with a rich literary tradition. As Iran is a Muslim country, it also uses two separate calendars: the Hijri calendar, and the Western calendar for business affairs.<br /><br />Rick's objective eye captures the seeming contradictions in modern Iran: enforced modesty for women means that hair must be covered, yet high fashion and plastic surgery are equally visible. He's respectful at religious sites such as the tomb of Ruhollah Khomeini and the mosque at Esfahan, and makes an effort to be a polite guest. Jum'ah prayers were eye-opening: soldiers are both among the worshippers, and standing guard to prevent violence (because this was filmed and produced in 2008, there is no mention of the recent massive protests following the June 2009 elections). Rick also gives a mini-history lesson into Iran's tumultuous modern history, with archival footage of Iran's young oilfields, the last Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq. As an American, it was curious to see the Supreme Leader's (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) likeness everywhere rather than the president's. Steves also doesn't shy away from the fading \"Death to America\" murals in front of the American Embassy. The sheer number of these propaganda murals is staggering.  Yet young Iranians (more than half of the country's population of 70 million is under 30) seem generally pleased to make contact and to practice their English, even if some shy away from the camera. The young university students (most of the ones speaking on camera are women) are surprisingly eloquent as they try to express their views on Iran's government and its attitude towards the West.<br /><br />Rick's willingness to understand modern Iran on its own terms is a rewarding journey; smiles are rewarded at every turn, from dusty ancient villages to the modern hustle and bustle of Tehran. We're invited into a middle class family's home for an elaborate dinner. As Steves notes, \"Maybe we're all just struggling to defend the moral fabric of our respective societies. I've been wondering to what extent US-Iran tensions might be explained by caring people on both sides motivated by love and fear. And the flip side of fear is understanding. I came to Iran a little nervous.

Damon's quest to free his love Katherine, who was locked inside the Mystic Falls church in 1864, comes to an explosive head as Stefan rescues Elena from her vampire kidnappers. Matt and Caroline are still trying to make their fledgling romance work, while Jeremy has fallen for the strange new girl, Anna, who is much more than she appears to be. Even Tyler makes a (not-too-notable) appearance (his first post-hiatus, I think).<br /><br />All of the elements from the last several episodes come together in a satisfying conclusion, including the identity and purpose of the new vampires in town and Damon's quest to obtain Emily Bennett's grimoire in order to break the seal on the tomb. Elena, Stefan and Bonnie have promised to release Katherine, but not the other vampires. Unlike the previous episode, there are no flashbacks in \"Fool Me Once.\" Elena must appeal to Damon's attraction to her after she's broken his trust in the last episode; his acquiescence is vital to their scheme. Bonnie's grandmother (Jasmine Guy) also plays a pivotal role in opening the long-sealed tomb.<br /><br />The pacing, plot and performances show just how far this show has come since the pilot. There's a new maturity and depth of emotion to the storyline; several characters lose someone they loved. Ian Somerhalder shines in this episode; Damon is taken from hope to anger to the deepest grief, and we feel along with him every step of the way.

It has been at least a decade since I felt so strongly about a TV show; I was so moved by Blood Ties' strong female role model and intriguing blend of romance, police procedural, and the supernatural that I downloaded several episodes via iTunes and recruited several friends to the show.<br /><br />Blood Ties remains my favorite post-[[ASIN:B0000C23T1 Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)]] for its enchanting blend of humor, passion, action, moral dilemmas, and the mortal (and immortal) ties that bind.", "review_full": "Vampires are all the rage on the small screen. Just look at recent entries [[ASIN:B000WFW12S Moonlight - The Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]], or the CW's \"The Vampire Diaries.\"<br /><br />Blood Ties is a Canadian TV production that was filmed as a 22-episode season. In the US, Lifetime TV decided to split was was actually one season into two, with the first eleven episodes (\"Blood Price\" to \"Post Partum\") as Season One and the remaining eleven (\"Norman\" to \"Deep Dark\") as Season Two. This box set collects all 22 episodes for the first time in North America (the British box set that was released several years ago features all 22 episodes, but no extras). The TV budget doesn't allow top-notch special effects, but the show really works with what it has (the set designs are great, but the CGI is largely lacking), and its strength is in the writing and performances.<br /><br />Blood Ties revolves around Victoria \"Vicki\" Nelson, an ex-cop with Toronto's Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an on-again, off-again affair, and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for: someone is summoning demonic forces, and Henry Fitzroy, her new partner on the case, just happens to be a 480-year-old vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.<br /><br />The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huff's [[ASIN:0756405017 Blood Price (BLOOD SERIES)]]. The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons, incubi, reanimated corpses, shapeshifters, mummies, voodoo, ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual, deadly Henry (Kyle Schmid beat out RPatz as sexiest vampire in a recent poll). Vicki's new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen, who also has her eye on Henry.<br /><br />Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama. Its premise sounds promising in print, but without Blood Ties' cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction, it would amount to little more than a tired monster-movie-of-the-week retread. This is a show that wisely knows not to take itself too seriously, leading to fast and furious one-liners, visual gags and impeccable comedic timing. The entire Canadian cast and crew does a consistently amazing job of bringing Blood Ties to life, and it's great to see a Canadian production receive airtime in the States.<br /><br />The show's setting is Toronto but is filmed in Vancouver (with exterior shots of identifying Toronto landmarks), but it's still Canadian through-and-through, a rarity in days where tired Toronto is expected to double as Everyamericancity. This may be the first show since [[ASIN:B0000C23T1 Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)]] and [[ASIN:B0017KP8Y0 Due South: The Ultimate Collection - Three Complete Seasons]] that revels in its Canadianness.<br /><br />Although Blood Ties is currently off the air, its fan base continues to spread through word of mouth, [[ASIN:B003DJULX6 Blood Ties]] hidden object game featuring characters, locations, and audio from the show, and Internet groups, thereby bringing new viewers into the fold. It has been at least a decade since I felt so strongly about a TV show; I was so moved by Blood Ties' strong female role model and intriguing blend of romance, police procedural, and the supernatural that I downloaded several episodes via iTunes and recruited several friends to the show.<br /><br />Blood Ties remains my favorite post-[[ASIN:B0000C23T1 Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)]] for its enchanting blend of humor, passion, action, moral dilemmas, and the mortal (and immortal) ties that bind. Tanya Huff's source material has been toned down enough to allow families to enjoy Blood Ties together. Blood Ties protagonist Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) is a strong positive role model for women through her physicality, self-reliance despite disability, and intelligence.<br /><br />It's instantly obvious (except to American/Canadian networks who were reluctant to pick up the show for a second season, grrr...) why Blood Ties was nominated for numerous awards such as Constellation and Leo Awards. The entire cast, headed by Christina Cox (Vicki), Kyle Schmid (Henry), Dylan Neal (Mike), and Gina Holden (Coreen), has an outstanding chemistry that shines on-screen, and I can't wait to finally own the complete Blood Ties on DVD!", "review_title": "A fun entry in the vampire / detective genre...", "product": {"title": "Blood Ties: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]", "brand": null, "price": 49.98, "main_category": "Movies & TV"}}, {"parent_asin": "B004BCT2HU", "rating": 4.0, "timestamp_ms": 1289527163000, "review_excerpt": "With shipping and currency conversion, the German Open Air Live DVDs will run about twice what you'd pay for the US version, but it clocks in at 2 DVDs, 196 minutes and 28 songs total, far more than the 15 (!) on the PBS single-disc version.<br /><br />PBS \"Rock Symphonies\" Tracklist: *song NOT in broadcast program<br /><br />1.Kashmir<br />2.Schubert's Serenade<br />3.Smells Like Teen Spirit<br />4.Mission Impossible Theme<br />5.Walk This Way<br />6.Michael Jackson mini-medley -- Billy Jean / I'll Be There<br />7.I'll Stand By You<br />8.Peer Gynt<br />9.Asturias<br />10.Child's Anthem<br />11.Adagio (Albinoni)<br />12.Zorba<br />13.Hey Jude<br />14.Bicycle Race*<br />15.Live and let Die*<br /><br />German \"Rock Symphonies: Open Air Live\" Tracklist:  (ASIN B003V89YT6 and ASIN B00415Z9Y2, Available at Amazon.de)<br /><br />Tracklisting:<br />01.

The footage is the same as his German concert DVDs, but the American PBS versions are noticeably shorter than their German counterparts, and \"Rock Symphonies\" is no exception. However, this time around Decca has put more thought into the total package. David's first concert DVD seemed rushed into production, lacked any sort of interactive menus, and cut between songs with no warning and frequently no introductions (this was in part due to the fact that most of David's intros are in German for a German audience). On \"Rock Symphonies,\" the root menu is the same as the \"Rock Symphonies\" album cover, except the grey background rotates clockwise, giving the impression of movement. The \"Chapters\" menu features the promo photo of David standing on a rooftop with animated dark clouds sweeping across the sky. The \"Bonus Features\" menu is the close-up of David with eyeliner...gorgeous! There are two bonus tracks, \"Bicycle Race\" and \"Live and Let Die.\" These can only be accessed from the \"Bonus Features\" menu and not the full concert, apparently. The \"Behind the Scenes\" feature is the same as the North American EPK for \"Rock Symphonies\" (just shy of 6 minutes).<br /><br />Sound and picture quality are great (according to the back of the case, it's 5.1 Surround Sound and 2.0 Stereo). The biggest improvement over the PBS [[ASIN:B002D19EFG David Garrett: Live In Berlin]] is that the introductions flow smoothly into the songs, rather than cutting from song to song. There were actually more non-album tracks like \"Mission Impossible\", \"Peer Gynt,' \"Child's Anthem\" and \"Adagio in G Minor\" than \"Rock Symphonies\" tracks (\"Kashmir,\" \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" \"Walk This Way,\" and \"Asturias\"). Minus one star for leaving off David's smokin' cover of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets,\" which was hands-down one of the best covers on [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]. Australian guitarist Orianthi really rocked out with David on the Michael Jackson medley, which saw David exploring \"Billy Jean\" and \"I'll Be There\" on the heels of last year's cover of \"Smooth Criminal.\" It was also nice to see one song (\"Zorba's Dance\") carried over from the [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]] album of last year. However, compared to the German Open Air Live DVD, there are only thirteen tracks (plus the two bonus tracks accessed separately) clocking in at just shy of an hour. It's too bad that they didn't include the studio interviews with David that were filmed as part of the PBS pledge special as bonus materials, seeing as this is a PBS exclusive.<br /><br />Overall, the PBS \"Rock Symphonies\" DVD feels like Decca took more care with packaging and designing menus (using hi-res promotional photos from \"Rock Symphonies\" and adding animated backgrounds, for example). It's great to hear David add his own unique intros to the songs, like the stories about him being an ersatz drummer at a gig in London, or the story about when he was seventeen and a girl tried to kiss him on the beach. His connection to his fans is obvious...he dedicates one song to a \"couple in love\" in the audience, and he positively glows whenever he performs. If you're looking for the full David concert experience, by all means get one of the German versions: there'a a regular, Region 0 2DVD set, ASIN B003V89YT6 and a Blu-Ray version, ASIN B00415Z9Y2 at Amazon.de. With shipping and currency conversion, the German Open Air Live DVDs will run about twice what you'd pay for the US version, but it clocks in at 2 DVDs, 196 minutes and 28 songs total, far more than the 15 (!) on the PBS single-disc version.<br /><br />PBS \"Rock Symphonies\" Tracklist: *song NOT in broadcast program<br /><br />1.Kashmir<br />2.Schubert's Serenade<br />3.Smells Like Teen Spirit<br />4.Mission Impossible Theme<br />5.Walk This Way<br />6.Michael Jackson mini-medley -- Billy Jean / I'll Be There<br />7.I'll Stand By You<br />8.Peer Gynt<br />9.Asturias<br />10.Child's Anthem<br />11.Adagio (Albinoni)<br />12.Zorba<br />13.Hey Jude<br />14.Bicycle Race*<br />15.Live and let Die*<br /><br />German \"Rock Symphonies: Open Air Live\" Tracklist:  (ASIN B003V89YT6 and ASIN B00415Z9Y2, Available at Amazon.de)<br /><br />Tracklisting:<br />01.

I'd already read the novel several times, but seeing Stevenson's novel come to life on the small screen was an incredible journey. This was my first introduction to the Chieftains and Irish music (the majority of the Treasure Island soundtrack can be found on Film Cuts), and soon after, I bought my first tin whistle and learned to play the Treasure Island theme.<br /><br />The stellar cast is headed by Charlton Heston as the roguishly charming Long John Silver and a young Christian Bale fresh off of [[ASIN:B00003CX9U Empire of the Sun (Snap Case Packaging)]]]. Other notables include a cameo by horror master Christopher Lee as Blind Pew, Julian Glover as Dr. Livesey and Pete Postlethwaite as George Merry. The cast is largely composed of classically trained British theater actors and it shows.<br /><br />The film's sense of authenticity is also earned through its period costumes, makeup, and furnishings, elaborate sets and using the actual HMS Bounty rather than a model (I became obsessed with tall ships after seeing this). The film was a combination of soundstage and location footage filmed in England (Cornwall, Buckinghamshire, Devon) and Jamaica that fused seamlessly to transport the viewer from prim and proper English country estates to the sweltering, malaria-infested jungles of Treasure Island.<br /><br />The screenplay stays fairly faithful to the original novel; Long John is played to perfection by Heston, who infuses his role with a charming smile hiding a shark's voracious grin. Silver is not a cutesy one as played by Wallace Beery in Treasure Island; rather, he's as cutthroat as the shifty crew. Bale's Jim goes from a wide-eyed boy who'd never seen the world to one who's forced to come of age quickly and brutally at the hands of Silver and his crew. The screenplay plays up the interactions between Jim, Dr. Livesey, Squire Trelawney, and Captain Smollett (Clive Wood puts in a heroic turn with a fierce, I'm -going-down-with-my-ship-and-pirates-be-damned pride), and Silver and his crew.<br /><br />The pacing keeps things moving along briskly and efficiently, and the film's haunting ending (with a voiceover by Bale) will stay in your mind long after you see this. Of the several versions I've seen of Treasure Island, this was the most authentic and enjoyable, and it's long overdue to make an appearance on DVD. Forget Jack Sparrow; these are real, down-and-dirty swashbucklers. There are no CGI effects; only real tall ships, rusty cutlasses, and the glitter of gold and greed. The haunting score by the Chieftains ([[ASIN:B000008E72 Reel Music Film Scores]]) still haunts my dreams to this day.", "review_title": "\"Wild horses couldn't drag me back to that accursed place...\"", "product": {"title": "Treasure Island (1990) (DVD)", "brand": null, "price": 8.99, "main_category": "Movies & TV"}}}

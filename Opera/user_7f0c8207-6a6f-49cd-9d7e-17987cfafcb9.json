  "persona": "### Demographic Information\n[Participant] lives in Blacksburg, Virginia, alone, and is a PhD student studying computer science with a focus on machine learning.\n\n### Self Description\n[Participant] starts their day early by cooking and packing food before heading to the lab to study and work on tasks like model training and writing papers. In the afternoon, they attend meetings, and after work, they go to the gym, cook dinner, and relax at home, occasionally doing some online shopping; on weekends, they enjoy outdoor activities like cycling or hiking, and sometimes travel to larger cities for shopping and socializing.\n\n### Personality\n[Participant] appears to be introspective and intellectually curious. At work, they are driven by novelty and challenge, preferring to engage in tasks that offer learning opportunities and stimulate their curiosity. After work, they enjoy solitary activities such as reading and conducting personal research on topics of interest, but they also value spending some time with friends for social interaction.\n\n### Shopping Preference\n[Participant] prioritizes buying from official stores to avoid counterfeit products and cares about shipping speed and price, often opting for discounts. They prefer to buy items in-store if they are available and discounted. While they don't read reviews for nail polish due to brand loyalty and prior exposure to the colors, they do examine reviews with images for other purchases, especially for larger or unfamiliar products. [Participant] focuses on negative reviews that highlight quality issues but disregards those related to shipping or packaging. They use reviews to verify product quality and do pay attention to sponsored products, acknowledging them as advertisements but do not indicate if it affects their purchasing decisions.\n",
